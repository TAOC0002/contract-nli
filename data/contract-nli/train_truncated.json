The Earth monitoring competition Copernicus Masters aims to support the development of market-oriented applications based on Earth observation data. In 2017, the Copernicus Masters is again enriched by the Copernicus Accelerator, a European Commission programme. Through this initiative, the 50 best finalists of the Copernicus Masters, selected by an international expert panel will automatically be granted access to a business coaching scheme provided by high-level professionals, that will act as mentors. To actively participate in the Copernicus Accelerator programme, Mentor commits to the following Non-Disclosure-Agreement and Terms of Participation.\n1 Eligibility\nMentor is a resident of one of the Copernicus participating countries1 or is employed with a legal identity registered in the territory of one of the Copernicus participating countries, willing to support and help develop the Ideas of the finalists of the Copernicus Masters 2017 (hereinafter \u201cParticipants\u201d). Professionals who pursue becoming mentors need to apply via the dedicated platform, inserting all required details, which can be edited anytime by Mentor. Their request needs to be validated by the Organiser and the European Commission, who can refuse participation in case of non-eligibility or conflict of interest. After verification of all details entered, the Organiser will notify the Mentor about the outcome of his/her submission.\nEven after validation, the Organiser cannot guarantee that there will be an actual match between Mentor and Participants. Mentor confirms that Mentor has not been involved in the development of any of the Ideas to be coached at any stage and that Mentor has no personal or commercial connection to any Participant of the Copernicus Accelerator that would influence an objective development of Ideas.\n1 The Copernicus Participating countries include all the EU Member States, in addition to Norway and Iceland.\n2 Procedure and Terms of Participation\nThe Copernicus Accelerator programme is comprised of different phases, for a total coaching support of approximately one year, aimed at helping Participants\u00b4 Ideas achieving measurable results. When submitting the request to become Mentor, Mentor needs to specify in which fields he/she can support Participants, in order to allow a suitable matchmaking with the requests and needs communicated by Participants.\nWhen a Mentor is requested by a Participant of the programme, he/she can access the Participant's profile and examine the submitted idea, in order to decide whether to confirm the request or not. Mentors can only advise up to two participants.\nMentors will meet the Participants at the Accelerator Bootcamp, that will take place in line with the Awards Ceremony of the Copernicus Masters, the European Satellite Navigation Competition (ESNC), and the accompanying Satellite Masters Conference from 6 - 8 November 2017 in Tallinn, Estonia. Mentor\u00b4s participation to this event is mandatory, as it will set forth the official start of their relationship: Mentor and Participants will begin developing a coaching plan together, that will include objectives and KPIs of their affiliation.\nMonthly virtual interactions need to be planned by Mentor, to ensure a continuous acceleration of the Participants Ideas\u00b4 towards business maturity. A mid-term review and survey will be required by April 2018, to evaluate progress made and ensure that the recommendations of the coaching plan are currently implemented by Participants. In case of a non-positive matching or non-compliance to his/her assigned duties (having monthly interactions with the mentees, keeping contacts with the Copernicus Accelerator team, promptly informing the organizers about any relevant issue connected to the coaching relationship), Mentor may be replaced by a more suitable candidate for the Participants\u00b4 needs.\nMentor will actively support Participants until July 2018, and will then submit a final report together, detailing the outcome of the coaching experience. The Organiser will continuously monitor all relationships, in order to assist both parties and guarantee a positive outcome of the programme. Mentor needs to deliver all requested reports and schedule all requested meetings. The Organiser will provide Mentor with templates for the documents to be produced. Mentors and Participants will meet again at the closing bootcamp, held in October/November 2018, that will official seal the closing of their mentoring relationship.\nAt the end of the coaching service, Mentor will fill in a questionnaire on the coaching service and the overall experience and will also be subject to a specific questionnaire compiled by Participants.\n3 Payment\nThe Organiser will reimburse Mentor the travel arrangements and accommodation for the Acceleration Bootcamp in Tallinn in 2017 (a maximum of EUR 800) and the closing bootcamp in 2018 (a maximum of EUR 700). The coaching service provided by Mentor is worth a maximum fee of EUR 5,000 (VAT excluded) per Participant coached, that will be remunerated to Mentor at the end of the programme, after the submission and approval of the final summary report of the coaching relationships. Payment shall be made within 30 days from the receipt of invoice, and following the invoice verification by Organiser. No deductions will be made from the gross fees paid to mentor who shall be solely responsible for ensuring that all and any Government taxes and other deductions are paid by him/her.\n4 Definition of Confidential Information\n\u201cConfidential Information\u201d means any Idea disclosed to Mentor, all data and information, know-how, business concepts, software, procedures, products, services, development projects, and programmes contained in such Idea and/or its description and any conclusions. Confidential Information does not include:\n> information already known or independently developed by Mentor prior to the disclosure of any Idea;\n> information already in the public domain through no wrongful act of Mentor; or\n> information received from a third party who was free to disclose such information.\nIn case of doubt any information is deemed to be Confidential Information unless Mentor proves that such information is not confidential.\n5 Non-Disclosure of Confidential Information / Obligations of Mentor\nMentor shall not use any Confidential Information for any purpose except to review, assess and help develop the Participants\u00b4 Ideas.\nMentor shall not disclose any Confidential Information to any third party or to Mentor\u2019s employees and/or employer without the prior written consent of the Participants. Mentor shall require his/her employees who will have access to Confidential Information to commit to a non-disclosure agreement that protects the Confidential Information to at least the same degree as this Agreement. Mentor shall take all reasonable measures to protect the secrecy of, and avoid any unauthorised disclosure or use of Confidential Information. Such measures shall include the highest degree of care that Mentor utilises to protect Mentor\u2019s own confidential information of a similar nature, but no less than reasonable care.\nNotwithstanding Mentor\u2019s right to assess and rate the Ideas of the Participants, Mentor shall not use the Confidential information for his/her own or third parties purposes and shall not file for any intellectual property right protection for the Confidential Information or parts of it.\nMentor shall notify Organiser immediately in writing of any misuse or misappropriation of any Confidential Information that may come to Mentor\u2019s attention. Mentor agrees to segregate all Confidential Information relating to this agreement from Confidential Information of others to avoid commingling.\n6 Discontinuation of Use, Return of Materials\nAt Organiser\u2019s first request, Mentor shall:\n(a) discontinue all use of Confidential Information;\n(b) return to Organiser and/or Participants all materials furnished by Organiser and/or Participants that contain Confidential Information;\n(c) destroy any copy and all materials produced by and under control of Organiser and/or Participants that contain Confidential Information;\n(d) erase and/or destroy any Confidential Information contained in computer memory or data storage apparatus of, under control of or used by Mentor;\n(e) remove the Confidential Information from any software or data base of, under control of/or used by Mentor that incorporates or uses the Confidential Information in whole or in part; and\n(f) warrant in writing to Organiser, within ten (10) days after Organiser\u2019s request, that Mentor has taken all actions set out under (a) through (e) in this Clause 4.\n7 Notice of Required Disclosure\nIf Mentor is required by mandatory, non-appealable judicial or administrative process and/or order to disclose Confidential Information, then Mentor shall promptly notify Organiser and allow Organiser and the Participants reasonable time to oppose such process unless this is not admissible under a mandatory law, judicial or administrative order. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Mentor shall disclose Confidential Information only to the minimum extent required to comply with such order.\n8 Proprietary Rights, Limited Right to Use\nAny and all proprietary rights, including but not limited to rights to and in inventions, patent rights, utility models, copyrights, trademarks and trade secrets, in and to any Confidential Information shall be and remain with the Participants respectively, and Mentor shall not have any right, license, title or interest in or to any Confidential Information, except the limited right to review, assess and help develop such Confidential Information in connection with the Copernicus Accelerator 2017.\n9 Term\nThis Agreement shall be effective as of 2 May 2017 and may not be terminated except for important cause. Notwithstanding the termination of this Agreement, any Confidential Information must be kept confidential for as long as such Confidential Information is not publicly known unless it becomes part of the public domain through no wrongful act of Mentor. This agreement may not be changed or modified, except by an agreement in writing, signed by both parties.\n10 Governing Law\nThis Agreement and the rights and obligations of the parties hereunder shall be governed by the material laws of the Federal Republic of Germany.\n11 Jurisdiction\nThe place of jurisdiction for any and all legal disputes arising out of or in connection with this Agreement is Munich (Landgericht M\u00fcnchen I). Imperative places of jurisdiction under German Law shall remain unaffected by the foregoing.\n12 Notification of Unauthorised Use\nMentor shall notify Organiser immediately upon discovery of any unauthorised use or disclosure of Confidential Information or any other breach of this Agreement by Mentor, and will cooperate with\nOrganiser in every reasonable way to help Organiser regain possession of the Confidential Information and prevent its further unauthorised use or publication.\n13 Remedies\nMentor acknowledges that his/her obligations under this Agreement are necessary and reasonable in order to protect the Ideas and the Confidential Information. Each party further acknowledges that any breach by Mentor of Mentor\u2019s covenants and agreements set forth in this Agreement or threatened violation of such may cause irreparable injury to Organiser and to Participants.\n14 Miscellaneous\nThis Agreement shall be binding upon Organiser and Mentor, and their successors and assigns. This Agreement contains the entire agreement and understanding of the parties relating to the subject matter hereof and supersedes all prior discussions, agreements and understandings of every nature between them. This Agreement may not be changed or modified, except by an agreement in writing, signed by both\nof the parties.\nThe failure or delay on the part of either party to exercise any right under this Agreement shall not be deemed a waiver of any rights under this Agreement.\nMentor is aware that an unauthorised disclosure of the Ideas and of the assessment and development of the Ideas and of any Confidential Information may lead to serious damage to Participants and the Organiser of the Copernicus Accelerator 2017. This Agreement shall be for the benefit of the Participants.\nThe Organiser and the European Commission will use the Mentor\u00b4s contact information to inform him/her of all matters related to the Copernicus Accelerator 2017 and of any other issues the Organiser and the European Commission deem relevant and appropriate. The failure or delay on the part of either party to exercise any right under this agreement shall not be deemed a waiver of any rights under this agreement.\n",

            "text": "Mutual Non-Disclosure and Use of Information Agreement\nto Support Emergency Cyber Mutual Assistance\nThis Non-Disclosure and Use of Information Agreement (the \"Agreement'') is made and entered into as of this 15th day of June, 2016 by and among each entity that executes and delivers the signature page to this Agreement (each, a \"Participating Entity\" and collectively, the \"Participating Entities\").\nA. Each Participating Entity is participating in a voluntary effort to assist the Electricity Subsector Coordinating Council (ESCC) in developing and implementing one or more industry initiatives to provide cyber emergency assistance to entities in the electric sector (collectively, the \u201cCyber Mutual Assistance Program\u201d).\nB. In connection with the Cyber Mutual Assistance Program, each Participating Entity may voluntarily choose to request from or provide to another Participating Entity emergency cyber mutual assistance in response to a cyber emergency;\nC. The development and implementation of any Cyber Mutual Assistance Program, including any request or provision of cyber mutual assistance between Participating Entities, may necessitate the exchange of certain confidential or proprietary information.\nNOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the mutual covenants in this Agreement, the Participating Entities agree as follows:\n1. Purpose, Scope, and Definitions. The purpose of this Agreement is to permit each Participating Entity to exchange Confidential Information (as defined below) as needed to pursue the development and implementation of a Cyber Mutual Assistance Program, including any request for or provision of cyber mutual assistance between Participating Entities in response to a cyber emergency or in connection with any Cyber Mutual Assistance Program.\n\u201cConfidential Information\u201d under this Agreement consists of:\n(i) all information disclosed by any Participating Entity, or any of its employees, directors, officers, affiliates, partners, agents, advisors or other representatives (\u201cRepresentatives\u201d) pursuant to that Participating Entity\u2019s participation in or contribution to the development or implementation of a Cyber Mutual Assistance Program, including any Participating Entity\u2019s request for or provision of cyber mutual assistance, whether disclosed prior to or following the execution of this Agreement;\n(ii) any information or documentation produced by a Participating Entity, or any of its Representatives, under any Cyber Mutual Assistance Program or related to a specific request for or response to cyber mutual assistance, including any analysis of such information, and whether produced prior to or following the execution of this Agreement;\n(iii) any aggregation, consolidation, or listing of information or documentation disclosed by one or more Participating Entities, or any of their respective Representatives, pursuant to the development or implementation of a Cyber Mutual Assistance Program including any Participating Entity\u2019s request for or provision of cyber mutual assistance; and\n(iv) all observations of equipment (including computer screens) and oral disclosures related to the development of any Cyber Mutual Assistance Program or a specific request for or response to cyber mutual assistance, including the systems, operations, and activities of each Participating Entity, whether such observations or oral disclosures were made prior to or following the execution of this Agreement.\n2. Non-Disclosure and Use of Confidential Information. Each Participating Entity agrees (i) to maintain the confidentiality of all Confidential Information obtained, (ii) without the express permission of the Participating Entity providing such information, not to disclose such information to third parties, and (iii) to use such information only for the express purpose of developing and implementing a Cyber Mutual Assistance Program, including in connection with any request for or provision of cyber mutual assistance between Participating Entities. Each Participating Entity shall use the Confidential Information received hereunder only for the purposes identified in Section 1. Notwithstanding the forgoing, a Participating Entity may use and internally share Confidential Information as deemed necessary to respond to an actual or threatened cyber emergency that places, or has the potential to place, the Participating Entity\u2019s cyber systems at risk. Any other use shall be only with the prior written consent of the Participating Entity or Participating Entities that provided the Confidential Information sought to be used.\n3. Exemptions to Non-Disclosure. Notwithstanding Sections 1 and 2, a Participating Entity shall not have breached any obligation under this Agreement if the Confidential Information is disclosed to a third party when the Confidential Information:\n(a) was in the public domain at the time of such disclosure or is subsequently made available to the public by the Participating Entity who provided the Confidential Information, or otherwise consistent with the terms of this Agreement; or\n(b) had been received or independently developed by such Participating Entity at or prior to the time of disclosure through a process other than the development or implementation of the Cyber Mutual Assistance Program; or\n(c) is subsequently disclosed to the Participating Entity by a third party without restriction on use and without breach of any agreement or legal duty; or\n(d) subject to the provisions of Section 4, is used or disclosed pursuant to statutory duty, such as a public records act request, or an order, subpoena, discovery request, or other lawful process issued by a court or other governmental authority of competent jurisdiction or in a judicial proceeding; or\n(e) is disclosed by unanimous agreement of each of the Participating Entity or Participating Entities whose information is subject to such disclosure; or\n(f) after the time of its disclosure hereunder, becomes subsequently available to such Participating Entity on a non-confidential basis from a source not known by such Participating Entity to be bound by a confidentiality agreement or secrecy obligation in respect thereof.\n4. Notice of Pending Third-Party Disclosure or Unauthorized Disclosure.\n(a) In the event that any governmental authority issues an order, subpoena, or other lawful process or a Participating Entity receives a discovery request in a civil proceeding (\"Legal Process\") requiring the disclosure of any Confidential Information, the Participating Entity receiving such Legal Process shall notify in writing the other Participating Entities within five (5) business days of receipt. The Participating Entity receiving such Legal Process shall not be in violation of this Agreement if it complies with the Legal Process requiring disclosure of the Confidential Information after seven (7) business days following Participating Entity notification, as set forth above.\n(b) A Participating Entity shall not disclose any Confidential Information in response to a request under the federal Freedom of Information Act, 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552, as amended, or an equivalent state or local open records law, except as required by law as determined in the written opinion of such Participating Entity\u2019s legal counsel. Upon receipt of a Freedom of Information Act or public records disclosure request, such Participating Entity shall: (i) notify each Participating Entity or Participating Entities whose information is subject to such disclosure request immediately upon receipt of a request for public records that include all or part of the Confidential Information; and (ii) if, in the written opinion of the legal counsel for the Participating Entity receiving the information request, the Confidential Information is not legally required to be disclosed, treat the requested Confidential Information as exempt from disclosure to the extent permitted by applicable law. The Participating Entity receiving the information request shall cooperate with the Participating Entity or Participating Entities whose information is subject to such disclosure request in challenging the request or seeking another appropriate remedy, as necessary. If such challenge to the request is not successful and another remedy is not obtained, only that portion of the Confidential Information that is legally required to be disclosed, as determined in the written opinion of the Participating Entity\u2019s legal counsel, shall be disclosed.\n(c) Unauthorized Disclosure: If a Participating Entity becomes aware that Confidential Information has been or likely has been disclosed to a third party in violation of this Agreement, the Participating Entity will immediately notify the Participating Entity in writing that provided the disclosed Confidential Information, provide a description of the information disclosed, and provide reasonable assistance to the Participating Entity that provided the disclosed Confidential Information to recover the Confidential Information and prevent further unauthorized disclosure.\n5. Term. This Agreement shall remain in effect as to each Participating Entity unless and until a Participating Entity seeking to withdraw from the agreement provides ten (10) days\u2019 prior written notice to the other Participating Entities, then this Agreement shall terminate with respect to such Participating Entity at the conclusion of such ten (10) day period; provided, however, that termination shall not extinguish any claim, liability, or cause of action under this Agreement existing at the time of termination. The provisions of Sections 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6 shall survive the termination of this Agreement for a period of ten (10) years.\n6. Return or Destruction of Confidential Information. Upon termination of this Agreement, all Confidential Information in the possession or control of a Participating Entity and its Representatives that received such information shall be returned to the Participating Entity that disclosed the information, including all copies of such information in any form whatsoever, unless otherwise instructed in writing by the Participating Entity that disclosed the information. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the Confidential Information is retained in the computer backup system of a Participating Entity, the Confidential Information will be destroyed in accordance with the regular ongoing records retention process of the Participating Entity. In lieu of return, a Participating Entity may certify to the other Participating Entities in writing that all such Confidential Information, in any form whatsoever, has been destroyed. Notwithstanding anything in this paragraph 6 to the contrary, a Participating Entity may retain a record copy of any Confidential Information if required to do so by applicable law. In such an instance, such Participating Entity shall identify in writing the specific Confidential Information retained, and shall provide the affected Participating Entity or Participating Entities with a written commitment to return or destroy the retained Confidential Information upon the expiration of the retention period required by law. The obligation under this Agreement to maintain the confidentiality of all Confidential Information shall continue to apply to such retained Confidential Information for so long as the Participating Entity possesses such Confidential Information.\n7. Notices. All notices, requests, demands, and other communications required or permitted under this Agreement shall be in writing, unless otherwise agreed by the Participating Entities, and shall be delivered in person or sent by certified mail, postage prepaid, by overnight delivery, or by electronic mail or electronic facsimile transmission with an original sent immediately thereafter by postage prepaid mail, and properly addressed with respect to a particular Participating Entity, to such Participating Entity\u2019s representative as set forth on such Participating Entity\u2019s signature page to this Agreement. A Participating Entity may from time to time change its representative or address for the purpose of notices to that Participating Entity by a similar notice specifying a new representative or address, but no such change shall be deemed to have been given until such notice is actually received by the Participating Entity being so notified.\n8. Complete Agreement; No Other Rights. This Agreement contains the complete and exclusive agreement of the Participating Entities with respect to the subject matter thereof. No change to this Agreement shall be effective unless agreed to in writing by all of the then existing Participating Entities. This Agreement is not intended to create any right in or obligation of any Participating Entity or third party other than those expressly stated herein.\n9. No Warranties or Representations. Any Confidential Information disclosed under this Agreement carries no warranty or representation of any kind, either express or implied. A Participating Entity receiving such Confidential Information shall not be entitled to rely on the accuracy, completeness, or quality of the Confidential Information, even for the purpose stated in Section 1.\n10. Injunctive Relief. Each Participating Entity agrees that, in addition to whatever other remedies may be available to the other Participating Entities under applicable law, the other Participating Entities shall be entitled to seek injunctive relief with respect to any actual or threatened violation of this Agreement by a Participating Entity or any third party receiving Confidential Information.\n11. Choice of Law and Forum. This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of New York without giving effect to any choice or conflicts of law provision or rule that would cause the application of laws of any other jurisdiction.\n12. Assignment. This Agreement shall be binding upon the Participating Entities, their successors, and assigns. No Participating Entity may assign this Agreement without the prior written consent of the other Participating Entities.\n13. Construction of Agreement. Ambiguities or uncertainties in the wording of this Agreement shall not be construed for or against any Participating Entity, but shall be construed in the manner that most accurately reflects the Participating Entities\u2019 intent as of the date they executed this Agreement.\n14. Signature Authority. Each person signing below warrants that he or she has been duly authorized by the Participating Entity for whom he or she signs to execute this Agreement on behalf of that Participating Entity.\n15. Counterparts. This Agreement may be executed in counterparts, all of which shall be considered one and the same Agreement.\nIN WITNESS WHEREOF, the Participating Entities have executed this Agreement as of the date set forth above.\nDated: __________________________ Participating Entity:\nBy: ___________________________\nName:\nTitle:\n",

DEFINITIONS:\nA. \u201cConfidential Information\u201d as used herein any and all confidential and/or proprietary information concerning the Originating Party\u2019s business and such party\u2019s trade secrets, proprietary data and business data, whether oral or written, tangible or intangible, which is disclosed to or learned by the Receiving Party in the course of the Discussions or otherwise while working with the Originating Party, and/or discovered, developed, conceived, originated, appreciably modified, or prepared in scope of Receiving Party\u2019s relationship with the Originating Party, including but not limited to the following:\n1. Business plans, acquisition plans, expansion plans, business development plans;\n2. Financial information, personnel information, training information, management systems and recruitment strategies;\n3. All commercial data relating to the business and products of Originating Party;\n4. Identity and contact information regarding vendors and suppliers;\n5. Specifications regarding Originating Party\u2019s products (including inventions, formulas, machinery and equipment, use of raw materials);\n6. Pricing and marketing/business strategies;\n7. Details regarding manufacturing processes and techniques;\n8. Customer identities and customer contact information;\n9. Customer credit information;\n10. Information regarding customer preferences and particularized needs;\n11. Product development strategies, expansion plans, and internal business plans, procedures, or methods of operation; and\n12. Design documents or source code.\n13. \u201cConfidential Information\u201d shall not include information which, now or in the future, is available to the public (other than through improper disclosure by the Receiving Party); information rightly acquired from a third party without any obligation of confidentiality; information that is independently developed without the use of any Confidential Information; or information already known by Receiving Party prior to disclosure by Originating Party, as demonstrated by written evidence.\nB. \u201cCustomer\u201d as used herein shall include any person, firm or other business entity which receiving party has directly or indirectly contacted, who have contacted him/her, for whom he/she has conducted training sessions, or whom have been referred to him/her on behalf of Originating Party in regard to originating parties business with respect to the purchase or offering of Originating Party\u2019s products and/or services.\nC. \u201cOriginating Party\u201d as used herein shall refer to the party who discloses the Confidential Information or Intellectual Property to the Receiving Party.\nD. \u201cReceiving Party\u201d as used herein shall refer to the party who receives the Confidential Information or Intellectual Property from the Originating Party.\nE. \u201cRepresentative\u201d means directors, officers, employees, accountants, attorneys, lenders of funds and agents of a party or its affiliates.\nII. NON-DISCLOSURE AGREEMENT: Both parties recognizes and acknowledges that, in an effort to foster the Discussions one or both of the parties has provided and/or will provide, at no cost, fee, charge or expense to Receiving Party, Confidential Information of a special and unique value and nature developed and/or acquired by (and/or being developed or acquired by) Originating Party at great expense and cost to Originating Party which, if it were to come into the possession of Originating Party\u2019s competitors, would cause irreparable damage to Originating Party, its competitive advantage and its ability to operate profitably. Receiving Party acknowledges that, prior to its relationship with Originating Party and prior to execution of this Agreement, Receiving Party had no knowledge of any of the aforesaid information. Receiving Party therefore agrees that neither it nor its Representatives will at any time make any independent business or personal use of, retain, copy, divulge, disclose, reveal or communicate to any other person or organization (except as expressly authorized in writing by Originating Party, as required to analyze the Business Relationship or as required to fulfill Receiving Party\u2019s obligations to Originating Party) any Confidential Information. Both parties agree that the obligations under this Agreement are in addition to all duties and obligations imposed upon each party by operation of law including but not limited to common-law and statute. Both parties further agree that their obligations under this paragraph survive the termination of the relationship between the two parties.\nIII. LEGALLY REQUIRED DISCLOSURES: If Receiving Party is requested to disclose any Confidential Information of the Originating Party under applicable law, in any judicial or administrative proceeding, or in response to a formal request of a regulatory or governmental authority (including law enforcement), then, except as otherwise required to comply with applicable law, the Receiving Party shall promptly notify the Originating Party of such request so that Originating Party may resist such disclosure or seek an appropriate protective order, and shall provide all information and assistance reasonably requested by Originating Party in connection therewith, at the Originating Party\u2019s sole expense. If the Receiving Party is nonetheless compelled to disclose any Confidential Information of the Originating Party, the Receiving Party shall limit its disclosure to that which, in the reasonable opinion of counsel, is required under applicable law.\nIV. NO REVERSE ENGINEERING; WORK PRODUCT: Receiving Party shall not reverse-engineer, analyze, attempt to duplicate or otherwise attempt to determine the design or method of compiling samples, prototypes or products of the Originating Party except pursuant to a mutually acceptable, written agreement executed by the parties. In the event that Receiving Party performs any services or testing for or on behalf of Originating Party without entering into such a written agreement, then any information or data developed by Receiving Party in connection with such services or tests shall be considered the Originating Party\u2019s Confidential Information and shall be maintained as such and kept confidential in accordance with the provisions of this Agreement. All such information and data shall belong to Originating Party exclusively and Receiving Party shall execute any instruments determined by Originating Party to be reasonably necessary to confirm Originating Party\u2019s ownership thereof.\nV. NON-SOLICITATION OF EMPLOYEES AND/OR CONTRACTORS: Receiving Party recognizes and acknowledges that, while engaged in Discussions and/or while involved in a Business Relationship, such party will be in a position to utilize Originating Party\u2019s goodwill and have access to and/or utilize Confidential Information of Originating Party that would enable Receiving Party to take advantage of that goodwill and/or Confidential Information to the detriment of the Originating Party, by attempting, for example, to recruit or solicit employees, and/or contractors of Originating Party. Receiving Party agrees and acknowledges that this would have the effect of causing the cessation or curtailment of the Business Relationship and would otherwise unfairly damage the business prospects of Originating Party. Therefore, in consideration of the mutual agreements made in this Agreement, during the course of the Business Relationship and for a period of 36 months after termination of the Business Relationship, Receiving Party agrees not to directly or indirectly communicate, solicit, induce, hire, recruit, take away, employ, endeavor to employ (on Receiving Party\u2019s own behalf or on behalf of any other person or entity) or attempt to influence any employee or contractor in any way that may have the effect of causing the cessation or curtailment of their respective relationships with Originating Party.\nVI. NO COMMITMENT; NO LICENSE; NO WARRANTY: Neither party shall be obligated under this Agreement to commence or continue with any Discussions, enter into any particular Business Relationship, or disclose any particular Confidential Information to the other party. No express or implied license under any intellectual property rights of either party is granted or conveyed to the other party under this Agreement. ALL CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION IS PROVIDED UNDER THIS AGREEMENT \u201cAS IS\u201d WITHOUT WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, AND DISCLOSER DISCLAIMS ANY IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NON-INFRINGEMENT.\nVII. ATTORNEY'S FEES: If any legal action is brought by any party hereto, it is expressly agreed that the prevailing party in such action or dispute shall be entitled to recover from the other party attorney's fees and costs in addition to any other relief that may be awarded. For the purpose of this Paragraph, the \"prevailing party\" shall be the party in whose favor a final judgment is entered.\nVIII. SEVERABILITY: It is the intent and agreement of the parties to this agreement that, in case any one or more of the provisions of this agreement shall, for any reason, be held to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable, such invalidity, illegality or unenforceability shall not affect any other provision of this agreement and this agreement shall be construed as if such invalid, illegal or unenforceable provision had never been contained herein except that this shall not prohibit any modification allowed or agreed upon pursuant to the terms of this agreement or any right of reformation.\nIX. GOVERNING LAW AND VENUE: This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the procedural and substantive laws of the State of Missouri. The parties to this Agreement consent and designate St. Louis County, Missouri as the sole venue and location for any suit or other proceeding of any kind regarding any aspect of this agreement and all issues arising out of or relating to the independent relationship between the parties.\nX. ASSIGNMENT: This Agreement is binding upon and shall inure to the benefit of the parties hereto and the successors and the assigns of all parties herein. Each party may assign or transfer this Agreement to a successor business entity in the event of a merger, consolidation, transfer or sale of the assets of said party. Any purported assignment of this Agreement, other than as provided above, shall be void.\nXI. NOTICES: Except as expressly set forth to the contrary in this Agreement, all notices, requests, consents or other communications (each a \"Notice\") provided for or permitted to be given under this Agreement must be in writing and must be given either (i) by depositing the Notice in the United States mail, addressed to the recipient, postage paid, and registered or certified with return receipt requested or (ii) by delivering the Notice to the recipient in person, by courier, or by facsimile transmission. A Notice given under this Agreement is effective on receipt by the party to receive it. Any Notice to any party must be sent to or made at that party\u2019s address (or facsimile number if applicable) given below such party\u2019s signature or such other address or facsimile number as that party may specify by delivering a Notice in compliance with this paragraph.\nXII. EQUITABLE RELIEF: Each party recognizes that any actual or threatened breach of the provisions of this Agreement would cause irreparable harm to the other party, the extent of which would be difficult and impracticable to assess, and that money damages would not be an adequate remedy for such breach. Accordingly, in addition to and not in limitation of any other remedies at law or in equity available under the circumstances, and notwithstanding any jurisdiction and venue requirements of this Agreement, each party shall be entitled to seek immediate injunctive and other non-monetary equitable relief in any court of competent jurisdiction without the need or requirement of any bond, provided that if a bond is required, the bond shall not exceed $1,000.00.\nIN WITNESS WHEREOF, the parties, intending to be legally bound, have executed this Agreement as of the last date set forth below by the undersigned duly authorized representatives.\nDealer Pay, LLC ________________________________(Company)\nPO Box 1691\n________________________________(Street Address)\nSt. Charles, MO 63302\n________________________________(City, State, Zip)\nJulie R.

Definitions\nIn this Agreement:-\nConfidential Information means any and all information which is now or at any time disclosed to one party by the other party and shall include without limitation, data, know-how, formulae, recipes, processes, designs and design rights, photographs, drawings, plans, intentions, product information, trade secrets, market opportunities, specifications, manufacturing data, which is disclosed to EFCA before or after the date of this Agreement but shall exclude any part of such information which:-\n1.1 is or becomes in the public domain without breach of this Agreement by EFCA; or\n1.2 EFCA can show:-\n1.2.1 was in its possession or known to it by being in its use or being recorded in its files or computers or other recording media prior to receipt from the disclosing party and which was not previously acquired by EFCA from the disclosing party under an obligation or confidence, or\n1.2.2 to have been developed by EFCA, or EFCA\u2019s principals, at any time independently of any information disclosed to it by the disclosing party.\n2. Handling of Confidential Information\nEFCA shall maintain the disclosing party\u2019s Confidential Information in confidence and shall exercise in relation thereto no lesser security measures and degree of care than those which the receiving party applies to its own confidential information and which EFCA warrants as providing adequate protection against unauthorised disclosure, copying or use. EFCA shall ensure that disclosure of such Confidential Information is restricted to those employees or directors of EFCA and EFCA\u2019s principals having the need to know the same.

Limitations and Warranty\n4.1 EFCA shall:\n4.1.1 not divulge the disclosing party\u2019s Confidential Information, in whole or in part, to any third party; and\n4.1.2 make no commercial use of the same or any part thereof without the prior written consent of the disclosing party. Notwithstanding the foregoing, EFCA shall be entitled to make any disclosure required by law of the disclosing party\u2019s Confidential Information provided that it gives the disclosing party not less than two business days\u2019 notice of such disclosure.\n4.2 The disclosing party reserves all rights in its Confidential Information and no rights or obligations other than those expressly recited herein are granted or to be implied from this Agreement. In particular, no licence is hereby granted directly or indirectly under any patent, invention, discovery, copyright or other industrial property right now or in the future held, made, obtained or licensable by the other party. Nothing herein contained shall be deemed to impose on either party any obligation to give the other party the opportunity of giving a quotation or making a tender to the other party or to enter into any contract for services or for supply of goods and/or materials with the other party.\n5. Confidentiality\nEFCA agrees to keep the existence and nature of this Agreement confidential and not to use the same or the name of the disclosing party (or of any company in the Group of Companies of which the disclosing party forms part) in any publicity, advertisement or other disclosure with regard to this Agreement without the prior written consent of the disclosing party.\n6. Notices\nAny notice to be given under this Agreement shall be in writing and sent by facsimile transmission or sent by recorded delivery post to the receiving party at its business address as last notified in writing to the other party and shall be deemed to have been given on the date of the facsimile transmission or two days following that on which the notice was posted.\n7. Variations\nNo variation, alteration or modification of this Agreement will be valid unless in writing signed by a duly authorised representative of both parties.\n8. Non-Assignment\nThis Agreement is personal to the parties and shall not be assigned or otherwise transferred in whole or in part by either party without the prior written consent of the other party.\n9.

This agreement shall be governed by and enforced in accordance with the laws of the State of California, USA as applicable to contracts to be performed therein. The undersigned (hereinafter, collectively, \u201cBuyer\u201d) acknowledges its/his/her desire to receive from Epsteen & Associates (\u201cBroker\u201d) and from the owner of the Business, described above (\u201cSeller\u201d) certain information pertaining to the Business, the Seller and/or the possible sale of the Business (the \u201cTransaction\u201d). For purpose of this Agreement, (a) the term \u201cBuyer\u201d means all of undersigned, including both the potential buyer interested in the Transaction, and such buyer\u2019s broker, and both such buyer and buyer\u2019s broker are bound by the provisions of this agreement; and (b) any information provided to Buyer, or otherwise learned by Buyer, concerning the Business, Seller or Transaction shall collectively be referred to herein as \u201cConfidential Information\u201d. In consideration of Broker providing Confidential Information to Buyer, Buyer agrees to the following:\nKEEP INFORMATION CONFIDENTIAL\nBuyer acknowledges that any Confidential Information disclosed to others may be damaging to the Business and the Seller. Buyer understands that Confidential Information includes, without limitation: the fact that Business is for sale; financial details; identity of suppliers and customers; and any information not generally known by public. Buyer agrees not to disclose Confidential Information to anyone other than its/his/her advisors and affiliates who both (a) have a need to know the information in connection with the Transaction; and (b) have agreed by signing a copy of this agreement to be bound by the terms of this agreement. Buyer agrees that all copies of materials and data provided to Buyer (and any information derivative of such information) shall also be \u201cConfidential Information\u201d; and all Confidential Information shall be returned to Broker in the event that Buyer decides not to pursue the Transaction. Buyer shall be legally responsible for the actions and omissions of Buyer\u2019s advisors and affiliates.\nDIRECT ALL CONTACT THROUGH BROKER\nBuyer shall not contact the Seller or any other individual or entity associated with Seller or the Business including, without limitation, landlords, employees, suppliers or customers except upon the prior written consent of Seller. All correspondence, inquiries, and offers to purchase, and other documents relating to the Business or Transaction (all of which is \u201cConfidential Information) will be delivered solely through Broker, and all negotiations relating to the Business or Transaction will be conducted exclusively through Broker.\nUSE INFORMATION FOR EVALUATION PURPOSE ONLY\nWithout limiting the other restrictions in this agreement, Buyer agrees to use Confidential Information solely to internally evaluate the Business for the possible Transaction and not for any other purposes whatsoever.\nDO NOT CIRCUMVENT SELLER AND/OR BROKER Buyer will not circumvent Seller and/or Broker by contacting any person or persons involved with the Business including, without limitation, landlords, employees, suppliers or customers. CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION IS PROVIDED BY SELLER\nAll information about the Business is provided by the Seller and is not verified by Broker. Buyer understands that purchasing any business represents investment risks and that Buyer should obtain professional assistance from independent accounting, legal, and financial advisors to verify all information prior to consummating an agreement to purchase the Business. Buyer will not rely on the information provided by Broker or Seller, including the Confidential Information, but shall conduct its own independent due diligence. Seller (and not Broker) is the source of all information and statements about the Business. Broker makes no warranty, guarantee, expressed or implied, as to the accuracy of such information.\nBuyer agrees to defend, indemnify, protect and hold harmless Broker, and release Broker, in connection with all information provided to Buyer, including all Confidential Information, and in connection with any breach by Buyer of any of its obligations under this agreement.\nPROVIDE EVIDENCE OF FINANCIAL ABILITY\nShould Buyer present an offer to purchase the Business, Buyer will provide a financial statement and a personal and business history, and Buyer authorizes Broker and Seller to obtain through standard reporting agencies, financial and credit information about Buyer and/or the companies Buyer represents.\nENFORCEMENT\nBuyer acknowledges and agrees that any breach of any of its/his/her obligations hereunder will cause Seller and the Business irreparable harm for which Seller and the Business have no adequate remedy at law, and that Seller and the Business shall be entitled to injunctive and other equitable relief to prevent a breach or continued breach of this agreement, in addition to any other remedies Seller and Business may have at law or in equity, and that this agreement shall be specifically enforceable in accordance with its terms. Both Broker and Seller are beneficiaries of this agreement and are both entitled to enforce this agreement.\nIn any action or proceeding, whether or not resulting in litigation, between Buyer (or either of them) and Seller, or between Buyer (or either of them) and Broker, including any litigation to enforce any of the terms of this agreement, the prevailing party shall be entitled to recover, in addition to any damages or compensation received, its costs and expenses incurred in connection with such action or proceeding, including any reasonable attorneys\u2019 fees, expenses and court costs.\nWe, the undersigned, understand and agree that this agreement is legally binding upon us. We understand that Seller and/or Broker have the right to seek any and all lawful remedies to enforce the terms of this agreement. We acknowledge that we have read and understand the disclosures contained herein.\nBUYER: BUYER\u2019S BROKER/AGENT:\n_________________________________________ _________________________________________\nSIGNATURE DATE SIGNATURE DATE\n__________________________________________ __________________________________________\nPRINT NAME PRINT NAME\n",

If an oral disclosure occurs, it will be confirmed within fifteen (15) days following initial disclosure by a written communication stating at least the date and circumstances under which the disclosure occurred and the general nature of the information disclosed. When a writing contains Proprietary Information the writing will, prior to disclosure to the receiving Party, be marked by the disclosing Party with a suitable legend (such as \"Proprietary Information\") to indicate its Proprietary status. The Parties shall utilize no less than reasonable care in protecting Proprietary Information received from the disclosing party; such care shall be the same degree of care as though it were to protect its own confidential or proprietary information.\n6. The conditions of Paragraph 4 hereof shall not apply to information which:\na. Was in the public domain or generally available to the public prior to receipt thereof by the receiving Party from the disclosing Party, or which subsequently becomes part of the public domain or generally available to the public except by wrongful act of the receiving Party or an employee or agent of the receiving Party; or\nb. Was (i) in the possession of the receiving Party prior to receipt from the disclosing Party, or (ii) is later received by the receiving Party from a third party, unless the receiving Party knows or has reason to know of an obligation of secrecy of the third party to the disclosing Party with respect to such information; or (iii) is developed by the receiving Party independent of such information received from the disclosing Party; or\nc. Is generally disclosed by the disclosing Party to third parties without obligation of secrecy.\n7. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in Paragraph 4 hereof, Proprietary Information may be disclosed by a receiving Party to those of its employees and consultants who require knowledge thereof in connection with their duties in conducting the aforesaid purpose of this Agreement and who are obligated by written agreement to hold such Proprietary Information in confidence and restrict its use consistent with the receiving Party's obligations under this Agreement; and Proprietary Information may be disclosed to a legislative, judicial, or regulatory body requiring its disclosure, provided that, prior to such disclosure, the receiving Party has notified the disclosing Party of the requirement with an opportunity for the disclosing Party to object or seek an appropriate protective order.\n8. Upon written request of a Party who has disclosed Proprietary Information to a receiving Party, the receiving Party shall promptly return all Proprietary Information except that one copy may be retained by legal counsel of the receiving Party as evidence of what was disclosed.\n9.

This Agreement shall not be construed to grant to either Party any patent license, use license, know-how license, or any other rights except as specifically provided herein.\n10. This Agreement shall be effective on the date of its full execution by the Parties.\na. This Agreement shall terminate at the end of the period of years as provided for in paragraph 4 above, or upon the delivery of written notice of termination by a Party to the other Party; however, the obligations of a receiving Party pursuant to Paragraph 4 shall remain in effect for the term specified therein.\nb. Notwithstanding the termination of this agreement, the supplied data must be maintained and protected in accordance with its provisions for three (3) years following the termination of this agreement.

In no event shall either Party be liable to the other for indirect, special, consequential, punitive, exemplary, or incidental damages including, but not limited to damages for loss of use of facilities or equipment, loss of revenue, loss of profits or loss of goodwill regardless of (a) the negligence (either sole or concurrent) of either party; and (b) whether either party has been informed of the possibility of such damages.\n12. Each Party acknowledges that the Proprietary Information disclosed hereunder may be subject to export control, and that compliance with all appropriate Government regulations such as the International Traffic in Arms Regulations (ITAR), the Export Administration Regulations (EAR), etc., may be necessary to obtain required approvals before disclosing Proprietary Information to foreign nationals, businesses or governments.

            "text": "NON-DISCLOSURE AND CONFIDENTIALITY AGREEMENT\nThis Agreement is entered into as of _______________________ (the \u201cEffective Date\u201d), by and between Flix Entertainment LLC having offices at 2000 S. IH-35, Suite Q11, Round Rock, Texas 78681 (\u201cDiscloser\u201d) and __________________________________, having offices at ___________________________________________________, (together with its affiliates, including, but not limited to its professional third party service providers, its successors and assigns, hereinafter collectively referred to as \u201cRecipient\u201d).\nWHEREAS, Discloser is in the business of owning and operating a cinema/eatery/micro-brewery concept called Flix Brewhouse, which is currently being expanded nationwide (the \u201cCinema\u201d).\nWHEREAS, Recipient is generally familiar with the movie exhibition industry, and Discloser and Recipient hereby find it mutually beneficial to discuss business opportunities and technical matters with each other relating to Discloser\u2019s business, including, but not limited to strategy, planning, debt and/or equity financing solutions and ideas (collectively defined hereinafter as \u201cBusiness Opportunities\u201d).\nWHEREAS, it is in the interest of the parties hereto for Discloser to provide Recipient with certain valuable information that is considered highly confidential and proprietary, in order to most effectively further the discussions between Discloser and Recipient.\nWHEREAS, Recipient acknowledges and understands that it would be highly injurious to Discloser should Discloser\u2019s valuable and confidential information or identity be disclosed generally, or find its way into the public domain through the Recipient.\nNOW, THEREFORE, it is agreed that, except where modified in writing, the following terms and conditions shall be applicable to all communications between Discloser and Recipient:\n1. Confidential Information. It is contemplated that Confidential Information (as defined herein) will be transferred from Discloser to Recipient in connection herewith and that Confidential Information shall be used by Recipient only for purposes of evaluating whether it might have interest in discussing Business Opportunities with Recipient.\na. For purposes of this Agreement, \u201cConfidential Information\u201d shall mean any proprietary information belonging to Discloser relating to: (i) Discloser\u2019s proprietary technology, systems, service offering and products, including without limitation, plans and specifications, technical data, trade secrets, know-how, research, product plans, ideas or concepts, services, software, inventions, intellectual property rights, techniques, processes, developments, algorithms, formulas, technology, designs, schematics, drawings, engineering, and hardware configuration information (collectively referred to as \u201cTechnical Information\u201d); and (ii) proprietary information relating to the financial information of any of the principals of Discloser, Discloser\u2019s corporate financial information or its operations and business or financial plans or strategies, including but not limited to its identity, customers, customer lists, markets, real estate development plans, financial statements and projections, products, product pricing and marketing, financial or other strategic business plans or information (collectively referred to as \u201cBusiness Information\u201d), disclosed to Recipient by Discloser, either directly or indirectly, in writing, orally or by drawings or inspection of samples, equipment or facilities. For purposes of this agreement, Confidential Information shall be assumed to be of a confidential and/or proprietary nature by Recipient, as it is reasonable to assume and expect that said Business Information is highly relevant to the success of its Discloser\u2019s business and is not known to the public.\nb. The restrictions set forth herein shall not apply with respect to information designated by Discloser as Confidential which: (i) is known by Recipient at the time of receipt as evidenced by Recipient\u2019s records; (ii) is or becomes a part of the public domain without breach of the Agreement by Recipient; (iii) is obtained by Recipient from a third party under conditions permitting its disclosure to others; (iv) is independently developed by Recipient; or (v) is disclosed by Recipient pursuant to judicial action or Government regulations provided Recipient notifies Discloser prior to such disclosure and cooperates with Discloser in the event Discloser elects to legally contest and avoid such disclosure.\n2. Identification of Confidential Information. For the purpose of the Agreement, written Business or Technical Information (including that which is delivered electronically) that is considered to be Confidential Information by Discloser, shall be so marked by Discloser. Information that is furnished orally shall be considered Confidential Information if Discloser so indicates. Additionally, information furnished by Discloser shall be deemed Confidential Information if it is obvious from its content, in the context under which it is furnished.\n3. Subsequent Notice of Confidentiality. Discloser may give notice in writing that written or verbal information that has been previously furnished, but not declared confidential, is in fact confidential. This information is to be treated as Confidential Information by Recipient from the time of receipt of said notice. That being said, Recipient shall make every reasonable effort to mark all written copies of such information under its control as \u201cConfidential\u201d or \u201cProprietary\u201d and to make every reasonable effort to inform Discloser of any disclosures by Recipient to third parties of such information that may have occurred between the time of receipt of the information and receipt by Recipient of notice that such information is confidential. Recipient has no responsibility to attempt to control the use of such information by such a third party.\n4. Term, Non-Disclosure and Use. For a period of two (2) years from the date of receipt, all Confidential Information shall be maintained in confidence by Recipient, shall not be disclosed, published, communicated, divulged or revealed in any manner, to any other person, firm, corporation or other third party entity, including employees of Recipient who do not have a need to know, or who should not know any such details pertaining to Confidential Information in the course of their employment, except as may otherwise provided in this Agreement. Recipient further affirmatively agrees not to use any Confidential Information received from Discloser except for the express purposes set forth herein.\n5. No License Granted. Except as expressly provided herein, this Agreement shall not be construed as granting or conferring, either expressly or implicitly, any rights or licenses to Recipient, by the furnishing of Confidential Information by Discloser to Recipient pursuant to this Agreement.\n6. Ownership and Return of Confidential Information. All tangible information, including drawings, specifications and other information furnished hereunder shall remain the property of Discloser. Upon request, or if either party elects not to pursue any further business undertaking with the other, Recipient shall promptly return all tangible information, including any and all copies or partial copies thereof and thereupon confirm destruction of all information held electronically.\n7. No Warranty. No warranty or representation is made by Discloser that any information transmitted by it hereunder is true and correct, patentable or copyrightable, or that any such information involves concepts or embodiments that are free of infringement of other rights.\n8. Equitable Relief. Discloser and Recipient agree that it would be impossible or inadequate to measure and calculate Discloser\u2019s damages from any breach of the covenants set forth herein, especially with regard any breach associated with Confidential Information that was to be maintained behind the Information Barrier. Accordingly, the Recipient agrees that in the event of a breach of any of the covenants contained in this Agreement, Discloser will have available, in addition to any other right or remedy available, the right to obtain an injunction from a court of competent jurisdiction restraining such breach or threatened breach and to specific performance of any such provision of this Agreement. Recipient further agrees that no bond or other security shall be required in obtaining such equitable relief and that Recipient hereby consents to the issuance of such injunction and to the ordering of specific performance. If any action or proceeding is brought to enforce this Agreement because of an alleged or actual dispute, breach, default, or misrepresentation in connection with any of the provisions of this Agreement, should it prevail, Discloser shall be entitled to recover reasonable attorneys' fees and other costs incurred in such action or proceeding in addition to any other relief to which it may be entitled.\n9. Effective Date. This Agreement shall become effective as of date hereof and shall terminate upon the express written termination by either one of the parties hereto. Termination of the Agreement shall not relieve either party of any obligation set forth in Paragraphs 4 or 6 with respect to Confidential Information, and all such obligations shall continue until expiration of the period set 10. General Provisions. The following general provisions shall apply:\n(a) Governing Law: This Agreement will be governed by the laws of the State of Texas, without regard to its conflict of laws provisions.\n(b) Severability: If one or more of the provisions in this Agreement are deemed void by law, then the remaining provisions will continue in full force and effect.\n(c) Successors and Assigns: This Agreement will be binding upon the successors and/or assigns of the parties hereto.\n(d) Headings. All headings used herein are intended for reference purposes only and shall not affect the interpretation, or validity of this Agreement.\n(e) Entire Agreement. This Agreement constitutes the entire agreement and understanding of the Parties hereto with respect to the subject matter of this Agreement. Any amendment or modification of this Agreement shall be in writing and executed by a duly authorized representative of either the Discloser or Recipient.\nIN WITNESS WHEREOF, the parties hereto acknowledge that they have read and understand each and every term of this Agreement and agree to be bound by its terms and conditions, and agree that the effective date of this Agreement is as set forth herein.\nRECIPIENT:\n________________________________\nName: __________________________\nTitle: __________________________\nPlease send to: msilvers@flixbrewhouse.com\n",

Definition.\n\u201cConfidential Information\u201d means, in respect to each Party:\n(a) any information in which such Party claims a proprietary and/or confidential interest;\n(b) all confidential matters of such Party including, without limitation, technical know-how, trade secrets, technical data, new product strategy, new products or processes, analysis, compilations, concepts, technical processes, formulae, recipes, specifications, inventions, research projects, customer lists, pricing, pricing policies, operational methods, financial information, marketing information and other business affairs;\n(c) any information of a confidential nature concerning such Party\u2019s customers, suppliers or employees; and\n(d) any information such Party has received from others which they are obliged to treat as proprietary and/or confidential.\nThe Confidential Information of either Party includes all of the above information with respect to any entity controlling, controlled by, or under common control with, such Party.\nConfidential Information shall not include information which: (a) is in the public domain prior to the date of its disclosure to Recipient by the Disclosing Party; (b) is known and can be shown to be known by Recipient prior to the date of its disclosure to Recipient by Disclosing Party; (c) becomes part of the public domain by publication or otherwise, and is not the result of any unauthorized act or omission on the part of Recipient; (d) can be demonstrated to have been supplied to Recipient by a third party who is under no obligation to the Disclosing Party to maintain such information in confidence; or (e) is independently developed by Recipient without the use of the Confidential Information.\n2. Obligation of Confidence. Each Party hereby acknowledges and agrees that the Confidential Information constitutes valuable information, and the provisions of this Agreement are necessary to protect the secrecy and confidentiality thereof.\n(a) Recipient shall (i) maintain the Confidential Information in strict confidence and take all reasonable steps to prevent its disclosure to third parties; (ii) use at least the same degree of care as Recipient uses in maintaining the secrecy of its own Confidential Information (but no less than a reasonable degree of care); and (iii) prevent the removal of any proprietary, confidential or copyright notices placed on the Confidential Information.\n(b) Recipient may use the Confidential Information only in connection with the performance of the Agency Sales and Marketing Services with Distributor. Recipient shall not, at any time, make any use of the Confidential Information for any other purpose.\n(c) Recipient shall keep the Confidential Information confidential at all times and shall not disclose the Confidential Information to any person including its employees except to its employees, representatives, advisors and agents who have a need to know such information in connection with assisting Recipient for the purposes set forth in paragraph 2(b) above and who are required to keep such information confidential.\n(d) Notwithstanding the foregoing in this Section 2, Recipient may disclose to Principals, on whose behalf it is performing Agency Sales and Marketing Services with Distributor, and who have a need to know the Confidential Information provided that: (i) Distributor has been notified of the identity of such Principals and has agreed to the disclosure of Confidentiality Agreement under this Section 2(d), (ii) only the necessary portions of Confidential Information required by such Principals to evaluate and utilize the Agency Sales and Marketing Services is disclosed, and (iii) Principal has a Confidentiality Agreement in place with Distributor or has a Confidentiality Agreement acceptable to Distributor in place with Recipient.\n3. Return of Materials and Information. All Documents made available hereunder, including all copies, notes, summaries, and abstracts thereof, shall be returned to the Disclosing Party or destroyed upon completion of the Agency Sales and Marketing Services with Distributor or upon written request by the Disclosing Party, and Recipient shall certify in writing that it has complied with the provisions of this Agreement.\n4. Opportunity to Seek Protective Order. In the event Recipient is requested or required by applicable law, regulation or legal process (including a subpoena or other administrative or judicial request), to disclose any Confidential Information of the Disclosing Party, Recipient shall promptly notify the Disclosing Party so that it may seek a protective order or other appropriate remedy. Unless the demand shall have been timely limited, quashed or extended, Recipient shall thereafter be entitled to comply with such demand to the extent required by law. If requested by the Disclosing Party, Recipient shall provide reasonable cooperation (at the expense of the Disclosing Party) in the defense of a demand to disclose Confidential Information.\n5. Patent, Copyright or Trademark Infringement. Nothing in this Agreement is intended to grant any new or additional rights under any patent, copyright or trademark, nor shall this Agreement grant the Parties any new or additional rights in or to the Confidential Information, except the limited right to review and use such Confidential Information for the purpose outlined herein.\n6. Ownership. As between the Parties, all Confidential Information shall remain the property of the FSMA\nDisclosing Party. Recipient agrees not to assert any claim of ownership to the Confidential Information of the Disclosing Party or any portion thereof. Nothing set forth in this Agreement shall require Parties to share any Confidential Information with the other, and the Disclosing Party makes no representation or warranty as to the accuracy or completeness of any Confidential Information disclosed hereunder.\n7. Injunctive Relief. It is understood and agreed that damages are an inadequate remedy in the event of a breach or intended or threatened breach by any Party under this Agreement and that any such breach by any party will cause irreparable harm, injury and damage; accordingly, the Parties agree that the damaged party may be entitled, without waiving any additional rights or remedies (including monetary damages) otherwise available to it at law, or in equity, or by statute, to seek preliminary and permanent injunctive relief in the event of a breach or intended or threatened breach by any Party.\n8. Survival. The foregoing obligations of all Parties shall continue for a period of two (2) years from the date of last disclosure of Confidential Information by either party, unless a specific portion of the Confidential Information disclosed becomes generally known to the public before the expiration of such two (2) year period through no fault of the Receiving Party. However, with respect to trade secrets, such obligations will survive for so long as such Confidential Information constitutes a trade secret under the Uniform Trade Secrets Act.\n9. Governing Law. THIS AGREEMENT SHALL BE GOVERNED BY THE LAWS OF THE STATE OF THE PRINCIPAL PLACE OF BUSINESS OF DISTRIBUTOR AS SET FORTH IN THE FIRST PARAGRAPH ABOVE (REGARDLESS OF THE LAWS THAT MIGHT OTHERWISE GOVERN UNDER APPLICABLE PRINCIPLES OF CONFLICTS OF LAW) AS TO ALL MATTERS, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO MATTERS OF VALIDITY, CONSTRUCTION, EFFECT, PERFORMANCE AND REMEDY. The county in which the principal place of business of Distributor is located as set forth in the first paragraph above and the closest state or federal court to the principal place of business of Agency shall each be a proper (but not exclusive) place of venue for any suits to enforce this Agreement, and any legal proceedings to enforce the provisions hereof may be brought in the state or federal Court sitting in such county or the closest state or federal court to the principal place of business of Agency. Each Party hereby further irrevocably waives any claim that any such court lacks jurisdiction over it, and agrees not to plead or claim, in any legal action or proceeding with respect to this Agreement brought in any of the aforesaid courts, that any such court lacks jurisdiction over it or that such court is located in an inconvenient forum.\n10. Miscellaneous. This Agreement constitutes the final, complete and exclusive agreement between the Parties concerning the subject matter of this Agreement and supersedes all prior agreements, understandings, negotiations and discussions, written or oral, between the Parties with respect thereto. Any modification, rescission or amendment of this Agreement shall not be effective unless made in a writing executed by both Parties. In case any one or more of the provisions contained herein shall, for any reason, be held to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable in any respect, such invalidity, illegality or unenforceability shall not affect any other provisions of this Agreement, and this Agreement shall be construed and enforced as if such invalid, illegal or unenforceable provision(s) had never been contained herein, provided that such invalid, illegal or unenforceable provision(s) shall first be curtailed, reformed, limited or eliminated to the extent necessary to remove such invalidity, illegality or unenforceability with respect to the applicable law as it shall then be applied. Any waiver of, or promise not to enforce, any right under this Agreement shall not be enforceable unless evidenced by a writing signed by the party making said waiver or promise. The undersigned each represents that it has been duly authorized to execute and deliver this Agreement. This Agreement may be executed in any number of counterparts, each of which when so executed and delivered shall be deemed an original, including facsimile copies, but such counterparts together shall constitute but one and the same instrument.\nDISTRIBUTOR: ___________________ AGENCY: ________________________________\nBy: ___________________________ By: ______________________________________\nPrinted Name____________________ Printed Name: ______________________________\nTitle: __________________________ Title: _____________________________________\nDate: __________________________ Date: _____________________________________\n",

WHEREAS, in connection with the business relationship between the parties, PHCS will disclose confidential information to the Recipient; and\nWHEREAS, the Recipient has been advised of and acknowledges the competitive value and proprietary nature of the confidential information of PHCS and the damage that could result to PHCS if its confidential information is not treated in accordance with the terms and conditions of set forth in this Agreement;\nNOW THEREFORE, in consideration the mutual premises and undertakings contained herein, and other good and valuable consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of which is hereby acknowledged, the parties hereto, intending to be legally bound hereby, agree as follows:\n1. Definition of Confidential Information. As used in this Agreement, the term \u201cConfidential Information\u201d means all oral and written information furnished by, or on behalf of, PHCS to the Recipient or its Representatives (as defined below), which is not generally known to the public, including, without limitation, all trade secrets, products, procedures, manuals, guidelines, reports, communications, information regarding names and requirements of current and prospective suppliers, vendors and customers, technical information regarding current and prospective products and programs and the development and/or acquisition of future products, programs and enhancements, discoveries, concepts and ideas, nature and results of research and development activities, technical information on product or program performance and reliability, processes, formulae, techniques, \u201cknow-how,\u201d specifications, any \u201cprotected health information\u201d as defined in HIPAA regulations, 45 C.F.R. Parts 160 and 164, as amended from time to time, and any other material or information related to the business or activities of PHCS, whether or not protectible by patent, copyright or other laws, whether furnished before or after the date of this Agreement, together with any additional information derived from such information and contained in all analyses, compilations, studies or other documents or records prepared by the Recipient or its Representatives, as well as all copies and other reproductions thereof, whether in writing or stored or maintained in or by electronic, magnetic or other means, media or devices. As used in this Agreement, the term \u201cRepresentatives\u201d means, with respect to PHCS or the Recipient, their directors, officers, shareholders, members, managers, partners, employees, affiliates and controlling persons, and their agents, advisors and representatives (including without limitation attorneys, accountants and financial advisors).\n2. Exclusions from Confidential Information. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in Paragraph 1, Confidential Information does not include information which (i) was or becomes generally available to the public other than as a result of a disclosure by the Recipient or its Representatives; or (ii) was or becomes available to the Recipient on a non-confidential basis from a source other than PHCS, provided that such source is not bound by a confidentiality agreement with PHCS or otherwise prohibited from transmitting the information to the Recipient; or (iii) was within the Recipient\u2019s possession prior to its being furnished by or on behalf of PHCS, provided that the source of such information was not bound by a confidentiality agreement with PHCS in respect thereof or otherwise prohibited from transmitting the information to the Recipient.\n3. Use of Confidential Information. As a condition to the disclosure of the Confidential Information, the Recipient agrees to keep the Confidential Information confidential and not to disclose or otherwise use the Confidential Information for any purpose, other than for its business relationship with PHCS, without the prior written consent of PHCS. Accordingly, the Recipient agrees to treat the Confidential Information which it receives as it would its own confidential information and to take all reasonable precautions to prevent the unauthorized disclosure to any third party of any Confidential Information. The Recipient further agrees to disclose the Confidential Information only to those Representatives who need to know such information for the purpose of its business relationship with PHCS and who shall (i) be advised by the Recipient of this Agreement and the confidential and non-public nature of the Confidential Information, and (ii) agree with the Recipient to be bound by the provisions hereof. The Recipient shall be responsible for any improper use of the Confidential Information by its Representatives and agrees, at its own expense, to take all reasonable measures, including but not limited to court proceedings, to restrain its Representatives from unauthorized disclosure or use of the Confidential Information.\n4. In addition, without the prior written consent of PHCS, except to the extent Confidential Information may be disclosed to Representatives of the Recipient or pursuant to the exception identified in Paragraph 7, neither the Recipient nor its Representatives will disclose to any person (which shall be broadly interpreted to include, without limitation, any corporation company, group, partnership, trust, association or individual) (i) that the Confidential Information has been made available to them, (ii) that they have inspected any portion thereof, (iii) the existence of, or any of the terms, conditions or other facts with respect to, this Agreement or its business relationship with PHCS.\n5. No Warranty. Neither PHCS nor its Representatives make any representations or warranties as to the accuracy or completeness of the Confidential Information. Each Recipient agrees that neither PHCS nor any of its Representatives shall have any liability to the Recipient or its Representatives resulting from the use of the Confidential Information supplied by PHCS or any of its Representatives.\n6. No License or Transfer. The Confidential Information disclosed shall at all times remain the property of PHCS. No license of any trade secrets, copyrights, patents or other rights is granted by this Agreement or by any disclosure of Confidential Information.\n7. Destruction/Return of Confidential Information. Upon PHCS\u2019 request, all Confidential Information (and all copies, extracts or other reproductions in whole or in part thereof), whether in writing or stored or maintained in or by electronic, magnetic or other means, media or devices, shall be returned or destroyed (such destruction to be certified in writing) by an authorized officer and not retained in any form or for any reason.\n8. Compelled Disclosure. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth herein, in the event that the Recipient or its Representatives are requested or become legally compelled (by oral questions, interrogatories, request for information or documents, subpoena, civil investigative demand or similar process) to disclose any of the Confidential Information or take any other action prohibited hereby, the Recipient shall provide PHCS with prompt written notice so that PHCS may seek a protective order or other appropriate remedy and/or waive compliance with the provisions of this Agreement. In the event that such protective order or other remedy is not sought or obtained or that the compliance with the provisions of this Agreement is waived, the Recipient agrees that it will furnish only that portion of the Confidential Information which, in the reasonable opinion of its counsel, the Recipient is compelled to disclose without standing liable for contempt or suffering other censure or penalty. The Recipient further agrees that it will exercise its best efforts to obtain reliable assurance that confidential treatment will be accorded to that portion of the Confidential Information which subject to the compelled disclosure.\n9. Indemnification. The Recipient agrees to indemnify and hold harmless PHCS, and its affiliates, and its and their shareholders, directors, officers, members, managers, partners, employees and agents (collectively, the \u201cIndemnified Parties\u201d) from and against any and all costs and expenses (including without limitation reasonable attorneys\u2019 fees) incurred by or on behalf of any Indemnified Party arising out of any breach of any provision of this Agreement by the Recipient or its Representatives.\n10. Injunctive Relief. The parties acknowledge and agree that, in the event of any breach of this Agreement, PHCS might be irreparably harmed and unable to be made whole by monetary damages. It is accordingly agreed that PHCS, in addition to any other remedy to which it may be entitled in law or equity, will be entitled to seek an injunction to remedy breaches of this Agreement and/or to compel specific performance of this Agreement.\n11. Term. The Recipient\u2019s obligations of confidentiality and nondisclosure shall survive termination of PHCS\u2019 business dealings with the Recipient.\n12. Miscellaneous. It is understood and agreed that no failure or delay by PHCS in exercising any right, power or privilege hereunder shall operate as a waiver thereof nor shall any single or partial exercise thereof preclude any other or further exercise of any right, power or privilege hereunder. This Agreement (i) shall not be assigned by any party without the prior written consent of the other party; (ii) cannot be amended, nor can any of its provisions be waived, except by a writing signed by the parties; and (iii) shall be binding on and inure to the benefit of the parties and their respective successors and assigns. This Agreement shall be governed and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of New Jersey without giving effect to the conflict of laws provisions thereof. This Agreement represents the entire agreement among the parties relating to the treatment of Confidential Information.\nIN WITNESS WHEREOF, the parties hereto have executed this Agreement under their respective hands as of the day and year first above written.\nRECIPIENT\nSignature:\nBy Name (print):\nTitle:\nDate:\nPRINCETON HEALTHCARE SYSTEM\nBy:\nName:\nTitle:\n",

In order to work on this topic as well as to supervise and evaluate the work, the contracting parties may have to share and exchange confidential information regarding their institutions. For the contracting parties\u2019 protection, such information shall be subject to confidentiality. This agreement is exclusively concerned with the cooperation concerning the thesis as defined. The cooperation is based on mutual trust; disagreements will be settled amicably.\n\u00a7 1 Prohibited Actions\nThe contracting parties mutually agree not to make available to third parties without prior consent any confidential information which was made available to them during the duration of this agreement by the student or the contractual partner. In accordance with \u00a715AktG, related companies count as third parties.\n\u00a7 2 Definition\n(1) Confidential information for purposes of this agreement is any such information as\n1.

Where the author has clearly marked the graded assessment\u2019s cover page with a lock flag (\u201cSperrvermerk\u201d), the university, following the completion of the assessment procedure, will store the work in a proper and protected place.\n\u00a7 4 Permission\n(1) The university is permitted to handle confidential information in such a way and to such an extent as is necessary and usual to execute the cooperation; this included photocopying. In particular, the university is permitted to reveal confidential information to third parties in as far as this is necessary to allow for the proper performance of the assessment process. The proper performance of the assessment process includes all steps of the process including legal proceeding to object to assessment decision and an examination for plagiarism; the relevant examination and legal regulations apply. To clarify, this agreement negates neither the student\u2019s nor the university\u2019s duties under the examination regulations or university law.\n(2) The receiving party is permitted to disclose any information in as far as it is their legal or official duty to do so..\n\u00a7 5 Liability\nThe contracting parties agree to handle any confidential information they receive with the same care they would extend to similar information of their own in order to protect it from unauthorised disclosure or use. The extent of the liability for breaches of this confidentiality agreement as well resulting loss is limited to foreseeable loss.\n\u00a7 6 Property Rights\nThis agreement does not confer any rights, in particular property, licencing or replication rights, rights of use or any other commercial protected rights or options between the parties. A party making information available to the other, reserves the right to register its own protective rights with regard to the subject of such information.\n\u00a7 7 Coming into Force and Duration\nThe agreement comes into force at such time as the last party signs the agreement. Any duties under this agreement seize to exist five years after the coming into force thereof.\n\u00a7 8 Legal Relationships Existing Outside this Agreement\nNo employment or similar contract exists between the university and the student but a relationship governed by examination regulations. Thus the university does not have the right to impose a duty of confidentiality upon the student. The university is not liable for the student\u2019s compliance with any bilateral confidentiality agreements between student and company.\n\u00a7 9 Other\nOral agreement will be considered null and void. Any additions or amendments to this contract have to be in writing. The formal requirement can only be waived in writing. Only German law applies.\nPlace, Date Pace, Date\nFurtwangen University, Stamp, Company, Stamp,\nSignature Dean Signature Company Representative\nNoted and agreed:\nPlace, Date Place, Date\nSignature Thesis Supervisor if applicable: Signature 2nd HFU-Supervisor\n",

Therefore, the Parties hereby agree that they are bound by an obligation of confidentiality.\nThe Parties both believe, and hereby agree, that Confidential Information has significant commercial value that would be diminished by unauthorized disclosure. Accordingly, the commitments of confidentiality in this Agreement are a condition to the Parties\u2019 willingness to engage in the contemplated business discussions and planning.\nThe Parties agree that they shall not use any advantages derivable from such information in its own business or affairs, unless the same is done pursuant to a new agreement with all other signatories to this document. Each signing party shall be held responsible and liable in case of a breach of this Agreement both in a professional and personal capacity.\n2.

This identification shall be by way of formal correspondence (letter, fax or email) addressed to the other Party outlining the proposed information to be disclosed (without giving specific details), requesting the receiving Party to recognise this as Confidential Information and therefore being bound by this Agreement. The receiving Party has the right to accept the information under this Agreement or to decline the information in which case it will not be provided.\n3. OBLIGATION OF CONFIDENTIALITY\nThe Parties agree that when receipt of any Confidential Information has occurred:\n3a. The receiving Party shall not disclose or communicate Confidential Information to any third party, except as herein provided.

The receiving Party shall reasonably protect the Confidential Information with not less than the same degree of care exercised by its own personnel to protect its own, or publication of its own, most valuable confidential and proprietary information.\n4. OBLIGATION OF NON-COMPETITION\nThe non-competition provisions of this Agreement are an essential and material part of the total agreement, by which the Parties agree they shall not use any advantages derivable from such confidential information in their own business or affairs, unless the same is done pursuant to a new agreement executed by all signatories to this document.\n5. NON-CIRCUMVENTION\nThe Parties hereby agree on behalf of themselves, their officers, directors, agents, associates and any related parties, that they will not, directly or indirectly, contact, deal with or otherwise become involved with any entity or any other entities or parties introduced, directly or indirectly, by or through the other party, its officers, directors, agents or associates, for the purpose of avoiding the payment to the other Party of profits, fees or other amounts, without the specific written approval of the other Party.\n6. NO REPRESENTATIONS\nThe Parties both understand that each Party makes no representation or warranty as to the accuracy or completeness of the information it provides. The Parties both agree that neither Party, nor any of its advisers, representatives, agents, or employees shall be held liable for utilization of Confidential Information which results from the other Party\u2019s use of said information.\n7.

Confidential information is defined as information of any kind which is disclosed in oral, written, graphic, machine recognizable, and/or sample form, and which is not excluded from any obligation of confidentiality by section 3 below. HALO will limit the confidential information disclosed to the following subject matter if requested by recipient:\nInformation regarding HALO proprietary magnetics, semiconductors, and/or modular devices, including, but not limited to the details of overall circuitry, physical dimensions, construction philosophy, and cost.\n2. PERIOD OF CONFIDENTIALITY. RECIPIENT agrees that for a period of five (5) years from the effective date of this Agreement, RECIPIENT will not disseminate the confidential information except to it\u2019s employees who will be directly involved in the evaluation of the information, and furthermore RECIPIENT will use the same degree of care (but in no event less than reasonable care) to avoid disclosure or unauthorized use of such information as RECIPIENT employs with respect to confidential information of its own.\n3. NON-CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION. RECIPIENT shall have no obligation with respect to disclosure and use of information to the extent such information:\nA. is or becomes generally available to the public other than as a consequence of a breach of an obligation of confidentiality to HALO; or\nB. is made public by HALO; or\nC. is independently developed by RECIPIENT; or\nD. is received from a third party independent of HALO without breaching an obligation of confidentiality; or\nE. is required to be disclosed by the operation of law.\n4.

All information furnished to RECIPIENT by HALO shall, unless otherwise specified in writing by HALO, remain the property of HALO; and the written information, and any copies thereof, shall be promptly returned to HALO upon its written or destroyed by RECIPIENT at HALO\u2019s option.\n5. NO LICENSE OR PATENT RIGHTS. Nothing contained in this Agreement shall be construed as granting any license or right to RECIPIENT by HALO under any patent of the United States or a foreign country or otherwise (except for the evaluation purposes indicated above).\n6. REMEDIES. RECIPIENT recognizes that the remedy at law for any breach of its obligation under this Agreement will be inadequate, and hence, RECIPIENT agrees that HALO shall be entitled to equitable remedies, including injunction, in the event of breach by RECIPIENT.\n7.

Confidential Information means: (i) technologies in written or tangible form disclosed to COMPANY from time to time after the Effective Date of this Agreement by ROCHESTER and identified with particularity at time of disclosure and marked confidential; and (ii) technologies communicated orally or visually to COMPANY by ROCHESTER, if it is reduced to writing or other tangible form by ROCHESTER on or before the date thirty days after the date of such communication, marked confidential, and promptly delivered to COMPANY.\n2. After ROCHESTER receives a fully signed copy of this Agreement, ROCHESTER shall disclose to COMPANY Confidential Information solely for use by COMPANY in its internal evaluation of the Confidential Information\u2019s commercial prospects.\n3. COMPANY agree that, for a period of five (5) years after the date of its receipt of the last Confidential Information disclosed under the Agreement, it shall: (i) keep Confidential Information confidential; and (ii) not use the Confidential Information for any commercial purpose. The foregoing shall not apply to that part of any Confidential Information that:\n(a) is disclosed or used by COMPANY in accordance with any written consent granted by ROCHESTER; or\n(b) at the time of receipt by COMPANY was independently known by COMPANY; or\n(c) at any time becomes generally known to the public through no fault of COMPANY; or\n(d) has been or is made available to COMPANY by a third party having the lawful right to do so without breaching any obligation of nonuse or confidentiality to ROCHESTER; or\n(e) has been or is disclosed to others by ROCHESTER without similar restrictions on disclosure and use; or\n(f) COMPANY is required to disclose pursuant to an order of a judicial or administrative authority\n4. ROCHESTER authorizes COMPANY to disclose the Confidential Information to those of its employees and consultants who require the Confidential Information for the evaluation hereunder, and to potential licensees, provided each such employee, consultant and potential licensee has first entered into a written agreement in which it agrees to be bound by similar obligations of nonuse and nondisclosure as those imposed on COMPANY hereunder.\n5. COMPANY shall complete its evaluation within the period expiring on the date six (6) months after the date COMPANY receives the Confidential Information from ROCHESTER. If COMPANY believes the Confidential Information has scientific and commercial promise, COMPANY and ROCHESTER may elect to commence negotiations leading to an agreement governing COMPANY\u2019s commercialization of the Confidential Information.\n6. At the end of the Evaluation Period, COMPANY shall upon request of ROCHESTER, return to ROCHESTER all Confidential Information in its files to monitor its obligations under this Agreement.\n7.

This Agreement shall be construed and enforced under the internal laws of the State of New York.

Hereinafter such parties may be addressed individually as the \u201cParty\u201d and collectively as the \u201cParties.\u201d\nRECITALS\nWHEREAS, the Parties have been engaged in and/or expect to further engage in confidential written and oral communications (\u201cConfidential Communications\u201d) relating to the business affairs of the HNBA;\nWHEREAS, it is expected that Confidential Communications may involve the disclosure by or on behalf of the HNBA of information not in the public domain, including, but not limited to, business and financial information, membership lists, personal information concerning candidates for judicial or other government office provided by the candidates or other third parties, drawings, samples, devices, demonstrations, computer programs, analyses, studies, compilations, and other date, and proprietary and novel features contained in any of the foregoing, as well as communications that may be protected by the Attorney-Client and/or Attorney Work Product Privileges (\u201cConfidential Information\u201d).\nWHEREAS, the Parties wish to define their rights with respect to Confidential Information delivered to the other Party;\nNOW THEREFORE, in consideration of the above premises, it is agreed as follows:\n1. The term \u201cConfidential Information\u201d shall include:\n(a) All information that is delivered by or on behalf of the HNBA to the Board Member in written, graphic or electronic form and that is marked \u201cconfidential\u201d or \u201cproprietary;\u201d\n(a) Any information, whether in oral, written, graphic, electronic, machine readable or any other form, that is provided to the Board Member by or on behalf of the HNBA in connection with the Board Member\u2019s performance of his or her duties as an HNBA Board Member and that is not otherwise readily available to the public, including membership lists, financial reports, personnel evaluations, program plans and reports, memoranda, e-mail and communications related to HNBA business \u2013 whether originated by an HNBA member or not, and communications that may be protected by the Attorney-Client Privilege or the Attorney Work Product Doctrine;\n(c) Written and spoken information provided to the Board Member in the performance of his or her duty to evaluate prospective nominees for judicial or executive office who have requested the support of the HNBA, including but not limited to (1) completed questionnaires and any other data furnished by the candidate or third parties to the HNBA; (ii) confidential information gathered by the Board Member or told to the Board Member during any investigation or evaluation of any candidate being considered for endorsement; (iii) conversation, colloquy, deliberations, evaluations, and conclusions concerning a prospective nominee expressed during the evaluation or consideration of the candidates\u2019 qualifications or endorsement request; and (iv) the decision of any committee or the Board of Governors concerning whether a prospective nominee is qualified for appointment; and\n(b) Any personally identifiable information including, but not limited to, name, address, telephone number, date of birth, social security number, e-mail address or any combination thereof provided by or on behalf of the HNBA to the Board Member.\n2. All Confidential Information shall be subject to the restrictions of this Agreement. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, the amount, type, and items of Confidential Information disclosed by the HNBA shall be solely within its discretion and it may refuse to disclose information if it believes that it is not in its best interests to do so. In addition, while the HNBA will exercise its best effort to ensure that all Confidential Information it provides to Board Member is accurate and complete, the HNBA makes no representation or warranty as to the accuracy or completeness of the Confidential Information disclosed. The information may be redacted when the Candidate or third party places restrictions on further disclosure of the information.\n1. The Board Member agrees that the Confidential Information he or she receives shall be used solely for the benefit of the HNBA Board Work, and that all rights to the proprietary and novel features contained in the Confidential Information are reserved by the disclosing Party. The Board Member will not use or disclose Confidential Information to any third party for any purpose other than the performance of his or her duties as a Board Member of the HNBA unless and until the HNBA expressly authorizes the disclosure in writing. Board Member specifically agrees not to use any personally identifiable information provided by or on behalf of the HNBA, its contractors, affiliates, vendors, sponsors or employees, for any direct marketing and not to transfer such information to any third party.\n2. The Board Member agrees to restrict dissemination of Confidential Information to those persons employed by the Board Member (or the Board Member\u2019s employer) who require access to the Confidential Information so as to assist the Board Member in carrying out his or her duties to the HNBA and then only if such personnel has a clear understanding of the confidentiality obligations imposed by this agreement and also agrees to maintain the confidentiality of the Confidential Information in accordance with the terms hereof by signing this Agreement before any Confidential Information is disclosed.\n3. The HNBA agrees that the Board Member shall not be liable for any disclosure or use of any Confidential Information if:\n(a) Such Confidential Information is publicly available or later becomes publicly available other than through a breach by the Board Member of this Agreement; or\n(b) Such Confidential Information is lawfully obtained by the Board Member from a third- party or parties independent of the HNBA prior to the Board Member\u2019s disclosure;\n(c) The Board Member can demonstrate by documentary evidence or otherwise that such Confidential Information was known to him or her prior to its disclosure to the Board Member by the HNBA or was independently developed by the Board Member prior to such disclosure for purposes unrelated to his or her service as a Board Member; or\n(d) The Board Member was legally required to disclose the Confidential Information, provided that the Board Member (i) provides the HNBA and/or other disclosing party with written notice within five (5) days of knowing of such legal requirement so that the HNBA has the opportunity to pursue its rights regarding such potential disclosure, and (ii) utilizes reasonable efforts to obtain reliable assurances that the person receiving such Confidential Information will maintain the confidentiality of the same.\n6. The Board Member agrees that no license under any patent, copyright or other intellectual property right is granted by implication or otherwise to Board Members under this Agreement.\n1. Once the purpose of the disclosure is achieved, the HNBA will instruct the Board Member to destroy all Confidential Information supplied to the Board Member by the HNBA. The HNBA will keep a copy in its files for a period of two (2) years after the completion of each Candidate\u2019s specific request.\n2. The Agreement shall expire five (5) years from its effective date specified above unless earlier terminated by a Party by giving the other Party thirty (30) days written notice. Termination or expiration of this Agreement shall not relieve the Board Member of any obligation with respect to the Confidential Information disclosed or developed hereunder prior to termination.\n3. This Agreement embodies all the understandings between the Parties concerning the subject matter hereof, and merges all prior discussions and writing between them as to confidentiality of Confidential Information. Neither Party shall be bound by any conditions, warranties nor representations with respect to confidentiality of Confidential Information other than as expressly provided in this Agreement.\n4. This Agreement shall be governed by, and construed and interpreted in accordance with the laws of the District of Columbia, without regard to principles of conflicts of laws. This Agreement may be executed in separate counterparts, each of which shall be deemed an original and both of which together shall constitute one and the same instruments.\n11. In addition to all other legal rights and remedies the disclosing Party may have upon a breach of this Agreement by the receiving Party, the disclosing Party shall be entitled to specific performance or injunctive relief respecting the covenants contained herein, and the receiving Party expressly waives the defense that a remedy in damages will be adequate. Each of the Parties hereby agrees that the prevailing party in any action to enforce this Agreement shall be entitled to full recovery of its attorneys\u2019 fees.\n5. No failures of delay by the disclosing Party in exercising any right or privilege hereunder shall operate as a waiver thereof, nor shall any single or partial exercise thereof preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the exercise of any right or privilege hereunder.\nBoth parties signify their agreement to the above terms by signing or causing their authorized representatives to sign this Agreement effective as of the date specified in the opening paragraph of this Agreement.\nON BEHALF OF THE HISPANIC HNBA BOARD MEMBER\nNATIONAL BAR ASSOCIATION\nErica V.

Such software code would be subject to terms and conditions governing redistributable code as contained in the third party licensor\u2019s End User License Agreement (EULA). Vendor\u2019s use of such IBC provided software code is subject to such EULA provisions governing redistributable code and Vendor must ensure that its license agreement for the PMS Software will also pass down those terms and conditions to its licensees who receive a copy of any IBC provided software code. In the event IBC elects to utilize a development tool in the future that would require the provision of redistributable code that is subject to licensing requirements then the applicable EULA will be provided to Vendor in conjunction with the provision of any applicable compiled software code containing redistributable code generated using such development tool.\n(j) Vendor shall ensure that in its license agreement for the PMS Software:\na. It includes protections that protect IBC and its licensors and subcontractors from any liability to Vendor\u2019s licensees in respect of such licensee\u2019s use of any portion of the PMS Software that is developed in reliance upon the Confidential Information;\nb.

It includes a copyright notice sufficient to protect IBC copyright in any redistributed software code.\nd. It contains a prohibition against any further distribution by such licensee of any component of the PMS Software that incorporates the Confidential Information.\ne. It includes a prohibition against the use of any portion of the PMS Software that is developed in reliance upon the Confidential Information for the provision of services relating to practice management to third parties.\nf. It otherwise complies with all of the requirements contained in an applicable EULA provided by or identified by IBC.\n3. Remedies\nVendor acknowledges that monetary damages would not be a sufficient remedy for unauthorized disclosure of Confidential Information and that IBC shall be entitled, without waiving any other rights or remedies, to such injunctive or equitable relief as may be deemed proper by a court of competent jurisdiction, without the necessity of proving actual damages or posting any bonds.\nVendor agrees to defend any and all Claims that may be brought or alleged against IBC and/or its respective directors, officers, employees, agents or contractors, and indemnify and hold harmless IBC and its respective directors, officers, employees, agents and contractors, from and against any and all Claims or damages that may arise, by reason of any breach of this Agreement by Vendor, its personnel or contractors or from Vendor\u2019s use of the Confidential Information including any deficiency in or other issue relating to the use or distribution of that portion of the PMS System that is developed using the Confidential Information. For any Claims that IBC chooses to defend, the Vendor shall, to the extent requested by IBC, participate in and co-operate with and assist IBC in such defence and any related settlement negotiations.\n4. Miscellaneous\n(a) All Confidential Information, and all associated intellectual property rights therein, are and shall remain the exclusive property of IBC and its licensors. By disclosing Confidential Information to Vendor, IBC does not grant any express or implied right to Vendor to or under any patents, copyrights, trademarks, or trade secret information except as otherwise provided herein.\n(b) All Confidential Information is provided by IBC (i) on a non-exclusive basis and (ii) on an \u201cas is\u201d basis without any representation or warranty of any kind. Any use shall be solely at the risk of Vendor. Any software code included in the Confidential Information is for illustrative purposes only. IBC makes no warranties or representations with respect to the Confidential Information, including any warranties or representations that any Confidential Information will be accurate, complete or up-to-date, or free of errors or omissions or that any Confidential Information will be fit for any purpose. Vendor is solely responsible for ensuring that the Confidential Information is suitable for the Vendor\u2019s needs. WITH RESPECT TO THE HCAI SYSTEM, THE SERVICES, OR ANY CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION, IBC EXPRESSLY DISCLAIMS ANY WARRANTIES, REPRESENTATIONS OR CONDITIONS, IMPLIED OR EXPRESS, STATUTORY OR OTHERWISE, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO ANY WARRANTY OR CONDITION OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE OR NON-INFRINGEMENT.\n(c) IBC has or expects to enter into service agreements directly with Providers that will govern such Provider\u2019s access to and use of the HCAI System. However, IBC does not guarantee availability or operation of the HCAI System to Vendor. Without prejudice to any right an individual Provider may have against IBC, IBC shall have no liability to Vendor in respect of any failure or problem in the operation of the HCAI System, including any communication problems between Providers and the HCAI System. IN NO EVENT WILL THE MEASURE OF DAMAGES PAYABLE BY EITHER PARTY INCLUDE, NOR WILL EITHER PARTY BE LIABLE FOR, ANY CONSEQUENTIAL, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, EXEMPLARY OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES (INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, DAMAGES DUE TO BUSINESS INTERRUPTION OR LOST PROFITS, SAVINGS, COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGE OR GOODWILL) ARISING FROM OR RELATED TO THIS AGREEMENT, THE CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION AND/OR THE OPERATION OF THE HCAI SYSTEM, REGARDLESS OF THE TYPE OF CLAIM, WHETHER IN CONTRACT, TORT (INCLUDING FUNDAMENTAL BREACH OR FAILURE OF THE ESSENTIAL PURPOSE OF THIS AGREEMENT OR ANY REMEDY CONTAINED HEREIN), NEGLIGENCE, STRICT LIABILITY OR OTHER LEGAL OR EQUITABLE THEORY, WHETHER OR NOT FORESEEABLE, AND REGARDLESS OF THE CAUSE OF SUCH DAMAGES EVEN IF THE PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES IN ADVANCE. IBC\u2019S LIABILITY FOR ANY MATTER RELATING TO OR ARISING FROM THIS AGREEMENT, THE CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION AND/OR THE OPERATION OF THE HCAI SYSTEM, WHETHER BASED UPON AN ACTION OR CLAIM IN CONTRACT, WARRANTY, EQUITY, TORT, NEGLIGENCE, OR OTHERWISE, SHALL NOT EXCEED, IN THE AGGREGATE AND IN RESPECT OF ALL ACTIONS, CLAIMS AND DAMAGES, AN AMOUNT EQUAL TO FIVE HUNDRED DOLLARS.\n(d) This Agreement constitutes the entire agreement between the parties with respect to the subject matter hereof. It shall not be modified except by a written agreement dated subsequent to the date of this Agreement and signed by both parties. None of the provisions of this Agreement shall be deemed to have been waived by any act or acquiescence on the part of IBC, the Vendor, their agents, or employees, but only by an instrument in writing signed by an authorized employee of IBC and the Vendor. No waiver of any provision of this Agreement shall constitute a waiver of any other provision(s) or of the same provision on another occasion. No employee, agent or representative of IBC is authorized to make any additional representation, warranty or covenant on behalf of IBC.\n(e) If either party employs lawyers to enforce any rights arising out of or relating to this Agreement, the prevailing party shall be entitled to recover reasonable lawyers\u2019 fees and costs. This Agreement shall be construed and controlled by the laws in force in the Province of Ontario, and the parties further consent to non-exclusive jurisdiction and venue in the federal or provincial courts sitting in Toronto, Ontario. Vendor waives all defenses of lack of personal jurisdiction and forum non conveniens. Process may be served on either party in the manner authorized by applicable law or court rule.\n(f) This Agreement shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of each party\u2019s respective successors and lawful assigns; provided, however, that Vendor may not assign this Agreement (whether by operation of law, sale of securities or assets, merger or otherwise), in whole or in part, without the prior written approval of IBC. Any purported assignment in violation of this Section shall be void. HCAI may assign this Agreement to any entity which acquires responsibility for the operation of the HCAI System.\n(g) If any provision of this Agreement shall be held by a court of competent jurisdiction to be illegal, invalid or unenforceable, the remaining provisions shall remain in full force and effect.\n(h) IBC may terminate this Agreement with or without cause upon thirty (30) days prior written notice to the Vendor. IBC will not exercise such discretion to terminate the Agreement with a specific vendor except for commercially reasonable grounds. All sections of this Agreement relating to the rights and obligations of the parties concerning Confidential Information disclosed during the term of the Agreement shall survive any such termination. Upon any termination of this Agreement, Vendor shall use commercially reasonable efforts to, as promptly as is practical, remove any functionality incorporated in the PMS System that is based on the Confidential Information.\n(i) The parties confirm that each has read this Agreement in its entirety, that the Agreement is being entered into without undue influence or fraud or coercion or misrepresentation whatsoever, that each has had independent legal advice, that each understands its respective rights and obligations under this Agreement, and that this Agreement is being executed voluntarily.\n(j) It is the express wish of the parties that this Agreement and all related documents be drawn up in English. C\u2019est la volont\u00e9 expresse des parties que la pr\u00e9sente convention ainsi que les documents qui s\u2019y rattachent soient r\u00e9dig\u00e9s en anglais.\n IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the parties hereto have executed this Agreement.\nVENDOR: Insurance Bureau of Canada\nAddress:\nBy: By:\nName: Name:\nTitle: Title:\nDate: Date:\n",

In consideration of the mutual covenants contained in this Agreement, and the mutual disclosure of confidential information to each other, the parties hereby agree to the following:\n1. Definitions\n(a) \"Confidential Information\" means non public information that the Disclosing Party either designates as being confidential or which, under the circumstances surrounding disclosure ought to be treated as confidential. \"Confidential Information\" includes, without limitation, information relating to released or unreleased Disclosing Party software products, the marketing or promotion of any Disclosing Party product, Disclosing Party's business policies or practices, and information received from others that Disclosing Party is obligated to treat as confidential. Confidential Information disclosed to the Receiving Party by any Disclosing Party subsidiary and/or agents is also covered by this Agreement.\n(b) Confidential Information shall not include any information that: (i) is or subsequently becomes publicly available without Receiving Party's breach of any obligation owed to the Disclosing Party; (ii) became known to the Receiving Party prior to Disclosing Party's disclosure of such information to Receiving Party; (iii) became known to Receiving Party from a source other than Disclosing Party other than by breach of an obligation of confidentiality owed to Disclosing Party; or (iv) is independently developed or acquired legitimately by Receiving Party.\n(c) \"Confidential Materials\" shall mean all tangible materials containing Confidential Information, including without limitation written or printed documents and computer disks or tapes, whether machine or user readable.\n(d) \u201cDisclosing Party\u201d is the party disclosing the Confidential Information and/or the Confidential Materials.\n(e) \u201cReceiving Party\u201d is the party in receipt of the Confidential Information and/or the Confidential Materials.\n2. Restrictions\n(a) Receiving Party shall not disclose any Confidential Information to any third parties for three (3) years following the date of its disclosure by Disclosing Party to Receiving Party, except to Receiving Party's consultants as set out below. However, Receiving Party may disclose Confidential Information in accordance with judicial or other governmental order, provided that the Receiving Party shall give the Disclosing Party reasonable notice prior to such disclosure.\n(b) Receiving Party shall take reasonable security precautions, at least as great as the precautions it takes to protect its own Confidential Information, to keep confidential the Confidential Information. Receiving Party may disclose Confidential Information or Confidential Materials only to Receiving Party's employees or bona-fidae consultants on a need-to-know basis. Receiving\nParty will have executed or shall execute appropriate written agreements with its employees and consultants sufficient to enable them to comply with all the provisions of this Agreement.\n(c) Confidential Information and Confidential Materials may be disclosed, reproduced, summarised, or distributed only in pursuance of the Receiving Party's business relationship with Disclosing Party, and only as otherwise provided hereunder. Receiving Party agrees to segregate all such Confidential Materials from the confidential materials of others in order to prevent the danger of accidental disclosure.\n(d) Receiving Party may not reverse engineer, decompile or disassemble any software disclosed to Receiving Party.\n3. Rights & Remedies\n(a) Receiving Party shall notify Disclosing Party immediately upon discovery of any unauthorised use or disclosure of Confidential Information or Confidential Materials, or any other breach of this Agreement by Receiving Party, and will co-operate with Disclosing Party in every reasonable way to help Disclosing Party regain possession of the Confidential Information and/or Confidential Materials and prevent its further unauthorised use.\n(b) Receiving Party shall return all originals, copies, reproductions and summaries of Confidential Information and/or Confidential Materials, or at Disclosing Party's option, certify destruction of the same in writing to Disclosing Party.\n(c) Receiving Party acknowledges that monetary damages may not be a sufficient remedy for unauthorised disclosure of Confidential Information and that Disclosing Party shall be entitled, without waiving any other rights or remedies, to such compensation as may be deemed proper by a court of competent jurisdiction.\n(d) Disclosing Party may visit Receiving Party's premises, with reasonable prior notice and during normal business hours, to review Receiving Party's compliance with the Terms of this Agreement.\n4. Miscellaneous\n(a) All Confidential Information and Confidential Materials are and shall remain the property of the Disclosing Party. By disclosing information to the Receiving Party, Disclosing Party does not grant any express or implied right to Receiving Party to or under Disclosing Party patents, copyrights, trademarks, or trade secret information.\n(b) The terms of confidentiality under this Agreement shall not be construed to limit either party's right to independently develop or acquire products without use of the other party's Confidential Information. Further, either party shall be free to use for any purpose the residuals resulting from access to or from work with such Confidential Information, provided that either party shall maintain the confidentiality of the Confidential Information as provided herein. The terms \"residuals\" means information in non-tangible form, which may be retained by persons who have access to the Confidential Information, including ideas, concepts, know-how or techniques contained therein. Neither party shall have any obligation to limit or restrict the assignment of such persons or to pay royalties for any work resulting from the use of residuals. However, the foregoing shall not be deemed to grant to either party a license under the other party's copyrights or patents.\n(c) This Agreement constitutes the entire agreement between the parties with respect to the subject matter hereof. It shall not be modified except by a written agreement dated subsequent to the date of this Agreement and signed by both parties. None of the provisions of this Agreement shall be deemed to have been waived by any act or acquiescence on the part of the Disclosing Party, its agents, or employees, but only by an instrument in writing signed by an authorised officer of Disclosing Party. No waiver of any provision of this Agreement shall constitute a waiver of any other provision(s) or of the same provision on another occasion.\n(d) If either party employs lawyers to enforce any rights arising out of or relating to this Agreement, the prevailing party shall be entitled to recover reasonable lawyers fees. This Agreement shall be construed under the laws of England and Wales.\n(e) Subject to the limitations set forth in this Agreement, this Agreement will inure to the benefit of and be binding upon the parties, their successors and assigns.\n(f) If any provision of this Agreement shall be held by a Court of competent jurisdiction to be illegal, invalid or unenforceable, the remaining provisions shall remain in full force and effect.\n(g) All obligations created by this Agreement shall survive change or termination of the parties' business relationship.\nEXECUTED BY :\nFor and on behalf of ____________________________________________________\nBy :\nFull Name : ___________________________________________________\nDate : ___________________________________________________\nFor and on behalf of Infomagnet Ltd.\nBy : ___________________________________________________\nFull Name : ___________________________________________________\nTitle : ___________________________________________________\nDate : ___________________________________________________\n",

COMPANY X and COMPANY Y may be referred to individually as a \u201cParty,\u201d or collectively as the \u201cParties.\u201d Each Party may disclose information (and in that case be a \u201cDiscloser\u201d) and receive information (and in that case be a \u201cRecipient\u201d) under this Agreement.\nRecital:\nCOMPANY X and COMPANY Y wish to pursue a working relationship. In the course of exploring and in connection with such relationship, it may be necessary for each Party to disclose or make available certain Confidential Information as that term is defined below.\nNOW, THEREFORE, IN CONSIDERATION OF THE MUTUAL PROMISES MADE HEREIN, ALONG WITH OTHER GOOD AND VALUABLE CONSIDERATION, THE RECEIPT AND SUFFICIENCY OF WHICH IS HEREBY ACKNOWLEDGED, THE PARTIES AGREE AS FOLLOWS:\n 1. Purpose. This Agreement is made for the purpose of [insert purpose] (the \u201cPurpose\u201d).\n2. Confidential Information.\na. \u201cConfidential Information\u201d shall mean all confidential, proprietary and trade secret information and materials, whether in written, oral, visually, electronic or another format (including, for example, demonstrations, models or proto-types, software, computer tapes, audio or video tapes or recordings, other media), and whether intentionally disclosed or observed inadvertently, includ-ing, but not limited to, the following: [insert specific description if possible]; research, product plans or other information regarding the Discloser\u2019s prod-ucts or services and markets therefor, customer lists and customers, software, developments, inventions, processes, formulas, technology, designs, drawings, engineering, hardware configuration information, marketing, finances or other business information; information of a confidential, sensitive, non-public, or personal nature, including information belonging to a third party or for which the Company owes a duty of confidentiality; any other Company proprietary or confidential information, including but not limited to any materials or any oral and written communications between the parties marked \u201cconfidential,\u201d \u201cproprietary\u201d or similarly marked; or any materials which a reasonable person would recognize from the surrounding facts and circumstances to be proprietary or confidential.\nb. The Confidential Information that must be protected under this Agreement in-cludes (i) tangible information (such as written materials, models, and/or speci-mens) identified as being Confidential Information by an appropriate, conspicuous legend (such as \u201cConfidential\u201d or \u201cProprietary\u201d); (ii) information in oral or visual form that is identified as being Confidential Information at the time of disclosure and confirmed in writing as Confidential Information within fourteen (14) days after the disclosure; or (iii) information that, given the nature of the information or the circumstances surrounding its disclosure, reasonably should be considered to be Confidential Information\n3. Limitations. Confidential Information shall not include information that:\na. is or becomes known publicly through no fault of the Recipient; or\nb. is learned by the Recipient from a third party not under an obligation of confi-dence to the Discloser and who has legitimate and legal possession of the informa-tion; or\nc. is already known to the Recipient before receipt from the Discloser as can be proven by written records; or\nd. is independently developed by employees or consultants of the Recipient who did not have access to any Confidential Information received;\ne. is free of confidentiality restrictions by written agreement of the Discloser.\n4. Nondisclosure. Except as described elsewhere in this Agreement, the Recipient and those of its employees, officers, agents and affiliates permitted access hereunder will hold the Confidential Information in confidence and will take all necessary steps to pre-serve the confidential and proprietary nature of the Confidential Information. Without limiting the foregoing, the Recipient (1) will not disclose any Confidential Information to persons within its organization who do not have a need to know in order for the Recipient to engage in the Purpose; (2) will not disclose any Confidential Information to any person outside of its organization unless such person has a need to know in order for the Recipient to engage in the Purpose, and such person is bound by fiduci-ary or contractual duties of confidentiality to the Recipient that are at least as stringent as those contained in this Agreement; (3) will, if reasonably required, cause each of the Recipient\u2019s employees, officers, agents, affiliates and attorneys who have access to the Confidential Information to sign a confidentiality and non-disclosure agreement, for the benefit of the Discloser, containing terms at least as stringent as those contained in this Agreement, and, in any event, advise all of its employees, officers, agents, and affiliates of the confidential and proprietary nature of the Confidential Information; and (4) in all instances, exercise at least the same degree of care to maintain the secrecy of the Con-fidential Information as the Recipient exercises to protect its own most valuable trade secrets, but in no case less than reasonable care.\n5. Exception. If the Recipient is required by order of any court or other government or regulatory agency to disclose any Confidential Information belonging to any Dis-closer, it shall provide all Parties with prompt written notice within 3 business days of any such requirement so that the Parties whose Confidential Information is at risk may seek a protective order or take other appropriate action. Upon the request and at the expense of the requesting Party, the other Parties will reasonably cooperate with the requesting Party to obtain an appropriate protective order or other reliable assurance that confidential treatment will be accorded the Confidential Information. Subject to the foregoing requirements, it shall not be a breach of this Agreement for a Recipi-ent to disclose Confidential Information if such disclosure is: (a) in response to a valid order of a court or governmental body of the United States or any political subdivision thereof; (b) otherwise required by law; or (c) necessary to establish the Discloser\u2019s\nrights under this Agreement.\n6. Term. This Agreement applies to any Confidential Information that may have been provided by either Party before or after the Effective Date, and will continue to govern all disclosures of Confidential Information, until terminated on thirty (30) days writ-ten notice by either Party to the other, except that each Party\u2019s obligations relating to Confidential Information disclosed prior to termination will continue for so long as the Confidential Information remains confidential and proprietary.\n7. No Transfer. All Confidential Information disclosed by any Party shall remain the property of the Discloser. This Agreement does not confer any license, right, interest, or title in or to Confidential Information other than as expressly set forth in this Agree-ment. Further, the Parties agree that the Recipient shall use any and all Confidential Information received from the Discloser solely for the Purpose and no other use may be made without the Discloser\u2019s prior written consent, which shall be granted or with-held in its sole discretion.\n8. Protection. Each Party agrees to protect Confidential Information provided to it by the Discloser with at least the same degree of care as it protects its own confidential, proprietary, and/or trade secret information and shall promptly advise the Discloser, in writing, of any misappropriation or misuse, of which it becomes aware, of Confidential Information by any person.\n9. Personnel. Each Party may use the same personnel who receive Confidential Infor-mation under this Agreement on other projects similar to the Purpose so long as such Party does not breach the confidentiality of this Agreement.\n10. Return of Information. Upon the written request of the Discloser, the Recipient shall either destroy or return to the Discloser any and all Confidential Information in the Recipient\u2019s possession, except for one copy, which copy may be retained for archival purposes in a secure file. All copies of Confidential Information forwarded in error by any Discloser shall be destroyed in their entirety without the Recipient retaining an archival copy.\n11. Warranty. Each Party warrants that it has the right to disclose all of the Confidential Information it discloses, but does not otherwise make any representation as to the ac-curacy, suitability, or completeness of such Confidential Information. The Discloser will not be liable to the Recipient for any damage resulting from any use of the Confidential Information by the Recipient. All Confidential Information of the Discloser shall remain the exclusive and sole property of such Party. This Agreement grants no rights of ownership, licenses, and/or any other intellectual property rights, nor does it create any agency, partnership, joint venture or any other relationship not expressly stated herein.\n12. No Assignment. Neither Party shall transfer or assign any rights or delegate any ob-ligations herein, in whole or in part, whether voluntarily or by operation of law, without the prior written consent of the other Party, which shall not be unreasonably withheld. Notwithstanding the above, either Party shall have the right to assign this Agreement and the obligations hereunder to any successor-in-interest by way of a merger, acquisi-tion, or sale of all or substantially all of that Party\u2019s assets on condition that the assign-ee of this Agreement will assume all obligations and liability of the assignor under or in connection with this Agreement and agrees to be bound by the terms and conditions of this Agreement.\n13. Savings. If any provision or covenant of the Agreement should be held by any court to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable, either in whole or in part, the validity, legality or enforceability of the remaining provisions or covenants of this Agreement shall be unaffected.\n14. Entire Agreement. This Agreement contains the entire understanding between the Parties with respect to this subject matter, is valid if signed within forty-five (45) days after the Effective Date, and supersedes all prior understandings whether written or oral. Further modifications may be made if in writing and signed by authorized repre-sentatives of both Parties.\n15. Injunctive Relief. Each Party agrees that the wrongful disclosure of Confidential In-formation may cause irreparable injury that is inadequately compensable by monetary damages. As such, either Party may seek injunctive relief in any court of competent jurisdiction for the breach and/or the threatened breach of this Agreement in addition to any other remedies it may seek at law or equity, and the Recipient will not raise the defense of an adequate remedy at law.\n16. Indemnification. Each Party shall fully indemnify the other against any and all ac-tions, claims, liability, costs, damages, charges and expenses suffered or incurred in connection with or arising out of any breach by a Party of any of the provisions of this Agreement, or by any unauthorized disclosure or use of Confidential Information by a third party or by any employee of any Party to whom Confidential Information has been disclosed or who has been allowed access thereto. Each Party acknowledges and confirms that a breach of its obligations hereunder cannot be compensated adequately solely by an award of damages or indemnity or other pecuniary remedy, and that the non-breaching Party shall also be entitled in the event of any such breach to the rem-edies of injunction, specific performance, and/or other equitable relief in respect of any such breach. Nothing herein shall be construed as a waiver by either Party of any of its rights including rights to damages or indemnity or other pecuniary remedy.\n17. Attorneys\u2019 Fees. In any action to enforce, arising under, and/or relating to this Agreement, the prevailing party as determined by the court or other body with jurisdic-tion by agreement of the Parties, shall be entitled to recover from the other Party, in addition to all other awards and remedies to which it is entitled, its reasonable attor-neys\u2019 fees and costs incurred in connection with such action.\n18. Governing Law. This Agreement shall be construed in accordance with the laws of the State of [state] without regard to any conflict of law principles.\n19. Counterparts. This Agreement may be executed in counterparts, and constitutes the entire agreement of the Parties as to the Confidential Information being disclosed and supersedes all prior or contemporaneous agreements, whether oral or written, be-tween the parties. If any Confidential Information is made available by accessing either Party\u2019s Web site, this Agreement shall govern such Confidential Information without regard to any terms of use, \u201cclick wrap\u201d agreement, or any similar agreement contained thereon.\nNOW, THEREFORE, intending to be bound hereby, the Parties have executed or have caused this Agreement to be executed by their duly authorized officers.\nACCEPTED AND AGREED:\n[COMPANY X] [COMPANY Y]\nBy: By:\nName: Name:\nTitle: Title:\n",

For the purposes of this Agreement, \"Confidential Information\" shall mean any and all information provided by, or on behalf of, the Disclosing Party to the Receiving Party prior to or following the execution of this Agreement and in any way relating to the Purpose (including, without limitation, any and all intellectual property, business secrets, business information, business plans, financial and pricing information, business practices, financial statements and reports, project specifications, projections, schematics and drawings, trade secrets, processes, materials, customer lists, supplier lists, sales volume, territories, markets, current, future or potential acquisitions, technical, production, operational, marketing or sales information disclosed hereunder) provided in connection therewith, regardless of form or format, provided however that Confidential Information shall not include information which the Receiving Party can establish through written records: (a) is, at the time of disclosure, readily available to the trade or the public through no fault of the Receiving Party, provided however that that where any part of such information is readily available to the trade or the public but a compilation of information which includes such part is not so available then such compilation shall be treated as Confidential Information hereunder; or (b) was rightfully in its possession prior to the disclosure of such Confidential Information to the Receiving Party by, or on behalf of, the Disclosing Party.\n2. The Receiving Party shall use the Confidential Information solely for the Purpose and shall not use the Confidential Information in any manner except as reasonably required for the Purpose. Nothing in this Agreement obligates the Disclosing Party to make any particular disclosure of Confidential Information. This Agreement shall apply to all Confidential Information regardless of its form or medium, whether conveyed orally, visually, electronically or in writing, and whether or not it is designated as \"confidential\".\n3. The Receiving Party shall protect the Disclosing Party\u2019s interest in the Confidential Information and shall keep the Confidential Information confidential. The Receiving Party shall not disclose, allow access to, transmit or transfer the Confidential Information to any third party without the Disclosing Party\u2019s prior written consent, provided however that the Receiving Party may disclose the Confidential Information to those of its directors, officers and employees (\"Representatives\") who have a need to know the Confidential Information for the Purpose provided that the Receiving Party shall ensure that such Representatives treat the Confidential Information as confidential and at all times in a manner consistent with this Agreement and the Receiving Party shall be liable for any loss or damage resulting from any Representative failing to do so.\n4. The Receiving Party shall notify the Disclosing Party promptly of any unauthorized use or possession of the Confidential Information that comes to the Receiving Party\u2019s attention.\n5. In the event that the Receiving Party is required to disclose Confidential Information pursuant to any applicable law or an order from a court of competent jurisdiction, the Receiving Party shall only disclose such portion of the Confidential Information that it is legally required to disclose, and shall use all reasonable efforts to obtain confidential treatment for any Confidential Information so disclosed. The Receiving Party shall promptly notify the Disclosing Party of the required disclosure and any relevant information in respect thereto so that the Disclosing Party may take appropriate steps to protect such Confidential Information from such disclosure.\n6. The Confidential Information shall not be copied or reproduced in any form or stored in a retrieval system or database by the Receiving Party without the prior consent of the Disclosing Party except for such copies and storage as may reasonably be required internally by the Receiving Party for the Purpose. All copies of the Confidential Information shall contain the same proprietary notices which may appear on the original.\n7. The Receiving Party shall upon request immediately return to the Disclosing Party or destroy, as directed by the Disclosing Party, the Confidential Information and all copies thereof in any form whatsoever under the power or control of the Receiving Party or its Representatives and immediately destroy all compilations, analysis or derivative work relating to the Confidential Information. Where the Receiving Party satisfies its obligation to return or destroy the embodiments of the Confidential Information by destroying such embodiments, the Receiving Party will deliver to the Disclosing Party a certificate signed by an officer of the Receiving Party certifying such destruction of such embodiments. 8. All right, title and interest in and to the Confidential Information, including, without limitation, all patent rights, trade secret and confidential information rights, copyrights and other intellectual property, industrial, proprietary and other rights of any kind or nature, shall remain the exclusive property of the Disclosing Party, and the Confidential Information shall be held in trust and confidence by the Receiving Party for the Disclosing Party. The Disclosing Party shall retain title to all tangible media on which Confidential Information resides, including documentation, discs, and all copies thereof. No interest, license or any other right in, or to, the Confidential Information, other than expressly set out herein, is granted to the Receiving Party under this Agreement by implication or otherwise. Although the Confidential Information is obtained from sources believed to be reliable, the Confidential Information is provided hereunder on a strictly \"as is\", \"where is\", \"with all faults\" basis, and without warranties, conditions or representations of any kind, express or implied, and this Agreement, and the provision of Confidential Information, shall not constitute any representation, warranty or guarantee to the Receiving Party by the Disclosing Party whatsoever, including without limitation any representation, warranty or guarantee with respect to the Confidential Information infringing, violating, misappropriating or otherwise interfering with any rights of third parties. The Disclosing Party shall not be held liable for any errors or omissions in the Confidential Information or the use, or the results of the use of, the Confidential Information. The Disclosing Party shall have no responsibility for updating or correcting any Confidential Information provided hereunder.\n9. The Receiving Party understands and agrees that the Confidential Information is information of a confidential nature of the Disclosing Party, is consistently treated as such by the Disclosing Party and that the public release of this information shall cause irreparable damage to the Disclosing Party. The Confidential Information is being disclosed by the Disclosing Party in specific reliance on the commitments and representations of the Receiving Party in this Agreement. It is accordingly agreed that the Disclosing Party shall be entitled to injunctive relief to prevent breaches of this Agreement and to specifically enforce the terms and provisions hereof, in addition to any other remedy to which the Disclosing Party may be entitled at law or in equity.\n10. This Agreement constitutes the entire agreement between the parties hereto with respect to the subject matter hereof and restates and super cedes any prior understandings and agreements between the parties hereto with respect thereto. No failure or delay by either party in exercising any right under this Agreement shall operate as a waiver thereof or preclude any other or further exercise of such right or the exercise of any other right under this Agreement.\n11. This Agreement shall be binding during the Purpose and shall remain in effect for a period or 2 years after the Purpose is completed.\n12. This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the Province of Alberta and the federal laws of Canada applicable therein, without reference to conflicts of law principles. No Party may assign this Agreement.\n13. If any provision of this Agreement is declared invalid, illegal or unenforceable by a court of competent jurisdiction such provision shall be severed from the Agreement and all other provisions of the Agreement shall remain in full force and effect.\n14. This Agreement may be executed in counterparts. Each shall be deemed an original, but together shall constitute one and the same instrument.\nIN WITNESS WHEREOF, duly authorized representatives of the parties hereto, each after having had the opportunity to discuss this Agreement with their respective legal advisors, have executed this Agreement.\nJUST BIOFIBER STRUCTURAL SOLUTIONS CORP.\nSign: _______________________________\nName: _______________________________\nTitle: _______________________________\nRecipient Name\n______________________________________\nSign: _______________________________\nName: _______________________________\n",

PROVIDER, through its employee, the PROVIDER Contact, shall disclose CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION to RECIPIENT, through its employee, the RECIPIENT Contact, to enable RECIPIENT to fully evaluate such disclosure solely for the PURPOSE. CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION shall be indicated as confidential at the time of disclosure.\n2. RECIPIENT agrees to accept the CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION and to employ all reasonable efforts to maintain the CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION as secret and confidential, such efforts to be no less than the degree of care employed by RECIPIENT to preserve and safeguard RECIPIENT's own confidential information. The CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION shall not be disclosed or revealed to anyone except employees of RECIPIENT who have a need to know the CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION for the PURPOSE and who agree to be bound by the terms of this Agreement.\n3. It is hereby acknowledged by PROVIDER that RECIPIENT shall incur no liability merely for examining and considering the CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION. However, RECIPIENT agrees that it will not use the CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION for any purpose other than the PURPOSE without the prior written consent of PROVIDER.\n4. RECIPIENT\u2018s obligations under Paragraphs 2 and 3 above shall not extend to any part of the CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION:\n(a) that can be demonstrated to have been in the public domain or publicly known and readily available to the trade or the public prior to the date of the disclosure; or\n(b) that can be demonstrated, from written records, to have been in RECIPIENT's possession or readily available to RECIPIENT from another source not under obligation of secrecy to PROVIDER prior to the disclosure; or\n(c) that becomes part of the public domain or publicly known by publication or otherwise, not due to any unauthorized act by RECIPIENT; or\n(d) that is subsequently disclosed to RECIPIENT by a third party who is not under an obligation of confidentiality to PROVIDER; or\n(e) that is required by any law, regulation, or order of court to be disclosed by RECIPIENT. Prior to disclosing proprietary or CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION of the PROVIDER, the RECIPIENT shall first notify and provide it an opportunity to prevent disclosure.\n5. RECIPIENT's obligations under Paragraphs 2 and 3 shall extend for a period of five (5) years from the effective date of this Agreement.\n6. It is understood that nothing herein shall be deemed to constitute, by implication or otherwise, the grant to RECIPIENT of any license or other rights under any patent, patent application, or other intellectual property right or interest belonging to PROVIDER, or as permitting RECIPIENT to unfairly obtain the right to use any CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION which becomes publicly known through an improper act or omission on its part.\n 7. Neither party shall use the name of the other or any contraction or derivative thereof or the name(s) of the other party's faculty members, employees, or students, as applicable, in any advertising, promotional, sales literature, or fundraising documents without prior written consent from the other party.\n 8. The terms of this Agreement supersede any previous non-disclosure agreements or any other preliminary representations or understandings that have been entered into by the parties to this Agreement with regard to the subject CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION.\nWe agree to examine and consider the subject matter of the CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION on the foregoing basis.\nTHE JOHNS HOPKINS UNIVERSITY COMPANY\nBy: _____________________________ By: _______________________\nPrinted: _____________________________ Printed: _______________________\n(Name) (Name)\nTitle: _____________________________ Title: _______________________\nDate: _____________________________ Date: _______________________\nAGREED AND ACCEPTED:\nJHU Contact COMPANY Contact\nBy: By: ______________________\nPrinted: Printed: ______________________\n(Name) (Name)\nTitle: Title: ______________________\nDate: Date: _______________________\n",

The parties contemplate entering into business and technical discussions concerning both current and planned products; and\nB. It may be necessary or desirable for each party to disclose to the other party certain confidential or proprietary technical information in order to enable discussions to freely take place between them concerning the subject matter mentioned above.\nNOW THEREFORE in consideration of the premises, covenants and agreements herein set forth, the parties agree as follows:\n1. For the purpose of this Agreement, \u201cConfidential Information\u201d means information, technical or commercial, whether in visual or machine readable form, received by one party from the other which is marked \u201cConfidential\u201d or \u201cProprietary\u201d, or which would logically be considered confidential or proprietary in view of its relationship to the whole disclosure. Information initially furnished orally and identified by the disclosing party as confidential or proprietary at the time of disclosure will be confirmed by the disclosing party as Confidential Information in writing within thirty (30) days.\n2. The receiving party will not use, manufacture or sell any document, schematic, drawing, photograph, specification, specimen or any other material making up any part of the Confidential Information, or use any Confidential Information as a basis for the design or creation of any items or other means without the prior written consent of the disclosing party.\n3. For a period of five (5) years from the date of receiving it, all Confidential Information will be maintained in confidence by the receiving party, will not be disclosed to any third party or to any persons employed in its business other than those having a need to know for the purposes set forth above, and will be protected with the same degree of care as the receiving party normally uses in the protection of its own confidential and proprietary information, but in no case with any less degree than reasonable care. Each party further agrees not to use any Confidential Information received from the other party except for the purposes set forth above.\n4. The restrictions above will not apply to Confidential Information which:\n(a) Is known by the receiving party at the time of receipt;\n(b) Is or becomes a part of the public domain without a breach of this Agreement by the receiving party;\n(c) The receiving party obtains from a third party under conditions permitting its disclosure to others;\n(d) Is independently developed by the receiving party; or\n(e) Is disclosed pursuant to judicial action or government regulations, provided that the receiving party notifies the furnishing party prior to such disclosure and co-operates with the furnishing party in the event the furnishing party elects to legally contest and avoid such disclosure.\n5. The furnishing of Confidential Information pursuant to this Agreement shall not be construed as granting or conferring, either expressly or implicitly, any rights, licences or relationships.\n6. Each party shall retain all rights of ownership over all intellectual property associated with the above referenced subject matter, including the rights of ownership of patents, trademarks and copyrights.\nAll tangible information including, without limitation, documents, schematics, drawings, photographs, specifications, specimens or any other information submitted by either party to the other, will remain the property of the furnishing party. If either party elects not to pursue any further business undertaking, each party will promptly return upon request all tangible information including any and all copies thereof relating to all Confidential Information.\nNeither party shall not, and it shall ensure that any of its affiliates do not, for a period of five years from the date of this Agreement, without the prior written consent of the other party, induce any employee employed by the other party to leave such employ or offer to employ or employ such employee.\nThis Agreement shall be governed by and interpreted in accordance with the laws of the Province of Ontario.\nFailure to enforce any provision of this Agreement shall not constitute a waiver of any term hereof.\nIN WITNESS WHEREOF the parties have executed this Agreement as of the day and year first above written.\nCompany: _____________________________________\nPer: _________________________________________\nName:\nTitle:\nand\nPer: ____________________________________\nTom Kerber\n",

            "text": "Non-Disclosure and Confidentiality Agreement\n(Data Protection)\nBackground Information\nWhere an organisation or a non-NHS agency or individual is engaged to carry out or support an NHS or public sector function, the appropriate confidentiality and security requirements must be agreed.\nThe standard specified in the agreement should be consistent with the Information Governance standards expected of NHS and other public sector organisations. These are based on the requirements of the Human Rights Act 1998 and \u2018common law duty of confidentiality\u2019. The Data Protection Act 1998 reiterates this point and makes it a legal requirement that effective agreements exist where a third party processes data. In addition for support functions that do not directly process data but may become party to it, it is a requirement to keep information confidential.\nIn addition the organisation requires any contracted individual or organisation (in this case LSPs) to respect any commercial confidentiality and intellectual property claimed by the organisation in the provision and handling of documentation and information.\nAny patient information, particularly their health or treatment details, is highly sensitive. If such information was leaked to the wrong people, it could cause severe embarrassment to the patients concerned, their families and to the organisation. There could be legal action following such a breach of confidentiality.\nIn addition any inappropriate or unauthorised disclosure of commercially sensitive information or unlicensed reuse of intellectual property could be subject to legal action.\nThe Agreement:\nThis agreement relates to requirements of the Data Protection Act 1998, the Human Rights Act 1998, the \u2018common law duty of confidentiality\u2019 and the Freedom of Information Act (2000).\n1. The following terms apply where an organisation or its staff may gain access to, or have provided to it, personal identifiable information (defined within the terms of the Data Protection Act 1998) when working for, or with the \u2018data controller\u2019. It also applies where the contracted third party is privilege to commercially sensitive information, security related information and any intellectual property of the contracting organisation.\n2. The access referred to in point 1 above may include:\na. Access to or sharing of information held in any electronic format or on paper\nb. Information that is part of verbal discussions\n3. Any information (personal or organisational) will only be used for purposes agreed between the organisations. Information will be retained for a period agreed between the parties and destroyed by an agreed method.\nAgreed purposes are: To provide communication support in line with Deafness Resource Centre terms and conditions\nAgreed retention period: upon completion of assignment and invoicing\nAgreed destruction method: Shredding of paper based information and deletion of electronic information\n4. Any work involving access to personal identifiable information will be done by formally authorised staff of the organisation (except as provided in paragraph 5 below). The organisation shall keep a record of all such authorisations.\nInformation containing a unique number (e.g. NHS, NI or organisational) or a combination of items from the following list is \u201cpersonal identifiable data\u201d: Name, Address, Postcode, Date of Birth, Other Dates (i.e. death, diagnosis), Sex, Ethnic Group or Occupation.\n5. All personal identifiable information will be treated as confidential and will not be disclosed to any other persons outside the requirements of the above agreed purpose(s), without agreement of the \u2018data controller\u2019. Any organisational information marked as \u2018commercial\u2019 or \u2018sensitive\u2019 or by implication of the subject could prejudice the commercial interests of either party will be treated as confidential.\n6. A DRC email account to be used to send and receive personally identifiable data.\n7. Where the activities performed by the contractor (in this case LSP) do not require them to process information but they may become party to it by overseeing or overhearing, they will be required to keep such information confidential.\n8. Any breach of the terms of this agreement may result in termination of arrangements (including formal contracts) and legal action may be taken.\n9. The organisation (in this case LSP) is responsible for ensuring their staff/sub-contractors adhere to the terms of this agreement.\nDeclaration\nI agree to the above terms and conditions (Recipient)\nSigned: ______________________________ Print Name: _______________________________\nCompany Name (if applicable): ____________________________________ Date: _____________\nRepresentative of the \u2018data controller\u2019 (Disclosing party)\nSigned: _________________________________ Print Name: ________________________________\nOrganisation: Deafness Resource Centre Ltd Date: __________\n",
